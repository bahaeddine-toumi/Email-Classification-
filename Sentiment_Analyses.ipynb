            "NGI's Daily Gas Price Index published : January 14, 2002 TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together, there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies. Western Canada's established, heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come, the National Energy Board has been told. TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year-2002 expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States. TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about 15% to a sustained rate of 20 Bcfd until at least 2010. Titled the Westpath Expansion, TransCanada's proposal calls for $48.3 million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by 420 MMcfd or 16% to about 3 Bcfd. The route crosses southeastern B.C. from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the U.S. border, where it fills PGE Gas Transmission. Along with U.S. traders and power generators, customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd. and Powerex Corp., a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gas-fired power stations. TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in second-quarter 2002 for the B.C. System. The agenda matches growth under way on PGE. TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers, its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last year's boom in gas drilling. The pipeline has told the NEB that \"with continued demand growth, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to 20 Bcfd at least through this decade.\" Production from Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated 17.2 Bcfd in 2001. TransCanada also predicts that \"unconventional gas\" -- chiefly coalbed methane, and possibly reserves in \"tight\" or difficult geological formations -- will enter production by about 2006 and eventually reach 4 Bcfd. But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas \"is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon (to the year 2025) and current technological assumptions.\" At the same time, TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada. In the absence of a performance record to guide reserves and production projections, the pipeline says only that \"if research and development and economics lead to successful commercial operations, these sources may start contributing supply this decade.\" In a separate toll case before the NEB, TransCanada predicts it will be 2008 before northern gas -- from either the Northwest Territories or Alaska -- begins to flow south. An announcement Jan. 14 by the Mackenzie Delta Producers Group and the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline Corp. suggested that TransCanada's educated guesswork is on the money. After nearly two years of preliminary feasibility studies and consultations with northern communities, the group -- Imperial Oil, Conoco Canada, Shell Canada and ExxonMobil Canada -- declared intentions to go ahead on a second planning stage. Next comes the \"project definition phase,\" or $200-$250 million in technical, environmental, commercial and consultation work required to make regulatory applications for field, gas-gathering and pipeline facilities. Conoco predicted the package will be completed and placed before Canadian authorities in 2003. The group says it intends to tap Arctic discoveries called Taglu, Parsons Lake and Niglintgak to send 1.2-1.5 Bcfd south to northwestern Alberta. The plan calls for the gas to finish its trip to markets via spare capacity on TransCanada's system. TransCanada is in step with the group's expectations in suggesting it will take five years beyond 2003 to collect approvals and build the project. The pipeline company's forecast suggests northern production will arrive gradually, going from a starting rate at 500 MMcfd in 2008 to 900 MMcfd in '09, 1.1 Bcfd in 2010, 1.2 Bcfd in 2011 and 1.4 Bcfd by 2012. The new forecast still does not predict which northern gas will flow, however. As a partner in the reborn Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., TransCanada is teamed up with eight other companies to revive the Alaska Highway pipeline route worked out in the 1970s for production from Prudhoe Bay. In the documents before the NEB, TransCanada says it \"recognizes various uncertainties with respect to northern gas supply regarding economics, timing, routing and scope. It's unclear as to which pipeline will be successful in attracting northern gas.\" \n",

            "ngi's daily gas price index published : january 14, 2002 transcanada plans export capacity additions while it will take another two years for a mackenzie valley production and pipeline project to come together, there are signs that a safety margin is developing in canadian natural gas supplies. western canada's established, heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come, the national energy board has been told. transcanada pipelines ltd. delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year - 2002 expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to california and the northwestern united states. transcanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about 15 % to a sustained rate of 20 bcfd until at least 2010. titled the westpath expansion, transcanada's proposal calls for $ 48. 3 million in new facilities to raise capacity on its british columbia system by 420 mmcfd or 16 % to about 3 bcfd. the route crosses southeastern b. c. from the alberta boundary to an export point on the u. s. border, where it fills pge gas transmission. along with u. s. traders and power generators, customers lined up for the added service include vancouver distributor bc gas utility ltd. and powerex corp., a subsidiary of bc hydro that procures fuel for gas - fired power stations. transcanada told the neb that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in second - quarter 2002 for the b. c. system. the agenda matches growth under way on pge. transcanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the neb, the alberta energy and utilities board and the canadian gas potential committee. the pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers, its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last year's boom in gas drilling. the pipeline has told the neb that \" faced with continued demand growth, the western canada sedimentary basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to 20 bcfd at least through this decade. \" production from alberta, b. c. and saskatchewan averaged an estimated 17. 2 bcfd in 2001. transcanada also predicts that \" unconventional gas \" - - chiefly coalbed methane, and possibly reserves in \" tight \" or difficult geological formations - - will enter production by about 2006 and eventually reach 4 bcfd. but the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas \" is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon ( to the year 2025 ) and current technological assumptions. \" at the same time, transcanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in canada. in the absence of a performance record to guide reserves and production projections, the pipeline says only that \" if research and development and economics lead to successful commercial operations, these sources may start contributing supply this decade. \" in a separate toll case before the neb, transcanada predicts it will be 2008 before northern gas - - from either the northwest territories or alaska - - begins to flow south. an announcement jan. 14 by the mackenzie delta producers group and the mackenzie valley aboriginal pipeline corp. suggested that transcanada's educated guesswork is on the money. after nearly two years of preliminary feasibility studies and consultations with northern communities, the group - - imperial oil, conoco canada, shell canada and exxonmobil canada - - declared intentions to go ahead on a second planning stage. next comes the \" project definition phase, \" or $ 200 - $ 250 million in technical, environmental, commercial and consultation work required to make regulatory applications for field, gas - gathering and pipeline facilities. conoco predicted the package will be completed and placed before canadian authorities in 2003. the group says it intends to tap arctic discoveries called taglu, parsons lake and niglintgak to send 1. 2 - 1. 5 bcfd south to northwestern alberta. the plan calls for the gas to finish its trip to markets via spare capacity on transcanada's system. transcanada is in step with the group's expectations in suggesting it will take five years beyond 2003 to collect approvals and build the project. the pipeline company's forecast suggests northern production will arrive gradually, going from a starting rate at 500 mmcfd in 2008 to 900 mmcfd in'09, 1. 1 bcfd in 2010, 1. 2 bcfd in 2011 and 1. 4 bcfd by 2012. the new forecast still does not predict which northern gas will flow, however. as a partner in the reborn alaskan northwest natural gas transportation co., transcanada is teamed up with eight other companies to revive the alaska highway pipeline route worked out in the 1970s for production from prudhoe bay. in the documents before the neb, transcanada says it \" recognizes various uncertainties with respect to northern gas supply regarding economics, timing, routing and scope. it's unclear as to which pipeline will be successful in attracting northern gas. \"\n",

            "NGI's Daily Gas Price Index Breaking News : posted Jan 16, 9:52 AM Dominion '01 Earnings Exceed Estimates Despite $348M 4Q Charges Dominion said Wednesday its 2001 operating earnings, excluding special charges, are expected to \"meet or slightly exceed\" analyst expectations of $4.15 per share, and it reaffirmed its 2002 earnings guidance of $4.90-4.95 per share. The higher earnings come despite fourth quarter write-downs of about $348 million, created by $97 million related to Enron Corp. exposure, a write-down of Dominion Capital assets worth $183 million, and a restructuring initiative announced in November, which will cost $68 million. The Richmond, VA-based integrated energy company said the Enron charge is \"related to credit exposure on past energy sales to Enron for which payment has not yet been received,\" totaling $6 million, and the \"impaired value of forward natural gas contracts with Enron,\" worth $91 million. Dominion said the Enron charges are non-cash, and with the fourth quarter charge, the company \"substantially eliminates any further Enron-related earnings exposure going forward.\" Dominion has hedged more than 60% of its expected 2002 gas volumes and has hedged about 40% of its expected 2003 gas volumes at prices \"significantly\" above current market prices. Because of the hedging program and cost-cutting initiatives, Dominion said it is \"positioned to exceed the consensus analyst estimate of $4.89 per share in 2002 and to grow earnings thereafter at an average annual rate of 10%.\" \"The Enron bankruptcy was the industry's equivalent of a 'thousand-year flood',\" said CEO Thomas E. Capps. \"The floodwaters are receding. As a result of some very costly but important lessons learned, the industry will be financially stronger overall. However, the Enron collapse has set in motion and accelerated a badly needed weeding-out process in the industry. The strong will get stronger and the weak will get weaker.\" Capps said a \"handful\" of \"financially strong, asset-heavy and integrated industry leaders, including Dominion, are already benefiting from a 'flight to quality' as energy users seek out suppliers they know they can count on to be there when the energy is needed.\" Another write-down, for Dominion Capital, is related to the value of its assets and increased loan loss reserves. When Dominion completed its merger with CNG in January 2000, it became a registered company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA), which prohibits registered companies from engaging in business not functionally related to the energy business. To comply with PUHCA, Dominion had to divest Dominion Capital, its financial services business, within a defined period, \"which happened to overlap a recession.\" The company said it anticipates no other Dominion Capital asset write-downs or loan loss reserve adjustments. \"We have conducted a rigorous review of all of our assets, with a particular focus on non-core assets,\" said Capps. \"There were significant fourth quarter events that led to a decline in consumer and business confidence and triggered an impairment of Dominion Capital assets. The adjusted values should allow us to pursue liquidation without negatively impacting earnings or the balance sheet going forward.\" Dominion has scheduled an earnings call for 10 a.m. EST on Jan. 24.

            "ngi's daily gas price index breaking news : posted jan 16, 9 : 52 am dominion'01 earnings exceed estimates despite $ 348m 4q charges dominion said wednesday its 2001 operating earnings, excluding special charges, are expected to \" meet or slightly exceed \" analyst expectations of $ 4. 15 per share, and it reaffirmed its 2002 earnings guidance of $ 4. 90 - 4. 95 per share. the higher earnings come despite fourth quarter write - downs of about $ 348 million, created by $ 97 million related to enron corp. exposure, a write - down of dominion capital assets worth $ 183 million, and a restructuring initiative announced in november, which will cost $ 68 million. the richmond, va - based integrated energy company said the enron charge is \" related to credit exposure on past energy sales to enron for which payment has not yet been received, \" totaling $ 6 million, and the \" impaired value of forward natural gas contracts with enron, \" worth $ 91 million. dominion said the enron charges are non - cash, and with the fourth quarter charge, the company \" substantially eliminates any further enron - related earnings exposure going forward. \" dominion has hedged more than 60 % of its expected 2002 gas volumes and has hedged about 40 % of its expected 2003 gas volumes at prices \" significantly \" above current market prices. because of the hedging program and cost - cutting initiatives, dominion said it is \" positioned to exceed the consensus analyst estimate of $ 4. 89 per share in 2002 and to grow earnings thereafter at an average annual rate of 10 %. \" \" the enron bankruptcy was the industry's equivalent of a'thousand - year flood ', \" said ceo thomas e. capps. \" the floodwaters are receding. as a result of some very costly but important lessons learned, the industry will be financially stronger overall. however, the enron collapse has set in motion and accelerated a badly needed weeding - out process in the industry. the strong will get stronger and the weak will get weaker. \" capps said a \" handful \" of \" financially strong, asset - laden heavy and integrated industry leaders, including dominion, are already benefiting from a'flight to quality'as energy users seek out suppliers they know they can count on to be there when the energy is needed. \" another write - down, for dominion capital, is related to the value of its assets and increased loan loss reserves. when dominion completed its merger with cng in january 2000, it became a registered company under the public utility holding company act of 1935 ( puhca ), which prohibits registered companies from engaging in business not functionally related to the energy business. to comply with puhca, dominion had to divest dominion capital, its financial services business, within a defined period, \" which happened to overlap a recession. \" the company said it anticipates no other dominion capital asset write - downs or loan loss reserve adjustments. \" we have conducted a rigorous review of all of our assets, with a particular focus on non - core assets, \" said capps. \" there were significant fourth quarter events that led to a decline in consumer and business confidence and triggered an impairment of dominion capital assets. the adjusted values should allow us to pursue liquidation without negatively impacting earnings or the balance sheet going forward. \" dominion has scheduled an earnings call for 10 a. m. est on jan. 24. to participate, call ( 800 ) 314 - 7867 or view a live web cast at www. dom. cominvestors. http : www. dom. cominvestors.\n",

            "Initially, Chris Ordway was assigned to schedule Dominion and Iroquois pipe lines. Now, after quickly mastering those two pipelines with their associa ted responsibilities, he is scheduling TETCO's market area and production a rea as part of a two person scheduling team. Chris has quickly learned the gas business and has adapted easily to change. He's been able to prioriti ze his workload and meet all scheduling deadlines as well as our weekly and monthly accounting deadlines. He has a strong desire to learn more about t he company and has made personal sacrifices to make sure his work gets done correctly the first time. I am very impressed at the speed at which he ma stered our trading system, Sitara and our nominations system, UNIFY. He ha s also now familiarized himself with 3 pipeline EBB's (NRG, Escript and Li nk) as well. He streamlined various pathing processes on Dominion and corr ected volume management issues on Dominion surrounding metered production. From a commercial perspective, the traders are impressed with his sense o f urgency during trading, his adaptability to change directions in mid-stre am and his ability to explore better economic options while scheduling gas on either Dominion, Iroquois or TETCO. Chris is very quick and forthcoming with information during trading. He doesn't try to solve all issues by hi mself. In addition, he will actively solicit other opinions before he atte mpts to answer operational problems. Chris has a very good sense of humor and is very easy to get along with. T hose traits are pivotal in a high-stress trading and scheduling environment . His communication skills allow him to extract pertinent information from customers, competitors and operations personnel. He's also very relentles s in his pursuit of information. Chris typically doesn't settle for a \"no\" answer or a response that doesn't make sense to him. He is the consummate team player. He backs up for Dominion and Iroquois and has scheduled all of TETCO marketproduction area at one time. Chris was willing to schedule 3 pipes at once in a backup role. He worked well with his partner and has built a good rapport with many of his industry contacts as well as his pip eline representatives. In a very high stress environment, Chris has never lost his cool or been disrespectful. Chris quickly learned all Enron internal systems as well as external pipeli ne systems and bulletin boards. For someone so new to the game, he's got a good understanding of how gas moves on his pipes. He can determine the be st mix of transportsuppliesmarkets to optimize flow and cost-effectivenes s. He also familiarized himself with the VNG asset management deal and deve loped a method to capture storage and burn figures correctly. Chris has th e complete trust of his peers, his traders and his management team when mak ing daily decisions affecting his pipelines. He shows a lot of interest i n learning and improving his understanding of the industry and the operati ons of his pipelines. Chris has a very bright future in this group and in this company. He is already working at the same level of performance as hi s peers that are at the senior specialist level. In addition, I was also p lanning on putting him up for promotion at year-end 2001 before the bankrup tcy occurred. Due to all these reasons, I recommend Christopher Ordway be promoted to Senior Specialist as soon as possible. Please feel free to call me with questions or concerns.

            " Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions. We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information provides further details about: -- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge; -- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications; -- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; -- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and -- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees. This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC. As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses. Restatement of Earnings Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001. These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position. Here are some details included in the filing: Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments. Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include: -- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997 -- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998 -- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 -- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000 -- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 -- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001 -- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001. The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000. The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001. You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at http:www.enron.comcorpsec. We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.\n",

With the October month-end close fast approaching, we want to provide you with an update as to the progress made in identifying and addressing the root causes for slow system response. Poor Performing Programs The ISC has identified a number of poor performing programs. Some program redesign has already occurred with continued efforts proceeding through year end. In addition, system and data base parameters as well as indexes have been tuned. These actions have resulted in improvements that should enable Enron to realize better system response in the upcoming close. Workload Distribution The ISC has identified jobs, both scheduled and user submitted, that result in system \"bottlenecks\". We have accelerated the purchase of system hardware to provide additional capacity and expect this upgrade to occur prior to year-end close. In addition, the ISC has implemented a plan to provide business users with more information regarding efficient methods of report execution. Workshops are currently being conducted with key \"close-users\" from the various business units to provide techniques that will enable more efficient report execution during the close process. Improved Close Monitoring The ISC has been working to heighten the monitoring of key close jobs in order to more effectively identify and resolve close related issues. An initiative is underway to improve the utilization of automated tools to better monitor, identify, and escalate close-related problems. Communication Strategy Implement The ISC has established a plan to more effectively communicate to our customers in the event of future system performance issues.

            " GISB IS NOW NAESB GISB is now officially NAESB. (The actual pronunciation is still undetermined!!!) I may unintentionally go back and forth between the names -- my apologies in advance. Also, some things are still officially 'GISB', such as the operating practices. There is still transition work to be done. At times it's a bit confusing and has already come up during a subcommittee meeting. I'm working to keep up with everything in NAESB, at least for a while, to watch for things that affect our quadrant and our processes. AGA is hosting two meetings in January in Washington, D.C. to discuss the retail gas and retail electric quadrants. Numerous meetings are being held by organizations such as NERC. These are being held in response to the FERC order issued December 19 (RM01-12), which addresses standards development for the wholesale electric industry. If the industry does not agree on a single standards development organization for wholesale electric standards by March 15, 2002, the FERC will either choose one or develop the standards themselves. GISB (NAESB) UPDATE MEETINGS Due to current events at Enron and then the holidays, I haven't held these meetings on a regular basis. I'm working on a regular schedule of meetings. People have said they want these to continue and prefer them to written updates. They want to know what's going on in GISB, including what's happening with NAESB. NOPR ON GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS I'll work with Nancy Bagot on our comments (due February 1). The El Paso pipelines will probably comment on standard 5.3.2 (the FERC asked for comments on whether they should adopt GISB's revisions). They will also get with INGAA to begin coordination of INGAA's comments. I'll let you know what I hear from other pipelines or other companies. GISB VERSION 1.5 Assuming the FERC adopts the version 1.5 standards, the implementation date for the title transfer tracking (TTT) standards is April 18, 2002. I'll work with the pipelines to ensure we're ready. As I recall, we've been in compliance with the proposed standards for a while. It would be a good idea to double check. The implementation date for the remainder of the standards could be as early as June 1, 2002. I'm working to determine the best way to update our copy of the version 1.5 standards to incorporate the corrections noted in the errata. It is very unlikely that GISB will correct the standards books. Other than the pipelines, none of the EC representatives have voiced a concern or an interest in having the books corrected. It will be difficult for our people (business and technical) to use separate documents (the standards books and the errata) when implementing. And, it will create greater opportunities for error. TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING I'm working with the IR chairs to finalize the data sets. Next, Technical will develop code values to be used on our Web sites. The data sets will then be sent to the EC for vote (EBB implementation only at this time) and will probably be included in version 1.6, scheduled for publication on July 31, 2002. Technical will develop the EDI implementation guides, which will be part of a later publication. INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS ENA has said that they will not continue to chair IR. They may try to participate. This leaves IR with only one chair. Dale Davis and I are filling in the gap. I'm not chairing any meetings -- I'm only helping outside the meetings. We have a candidate in mind for IR chair and we're working to bring him up to speed as quickly as possible. The current chair still is not working out, but the new chair should be able to handle the position and run IR. The better job the IR chairs do, the less I have to do. We are also working on a few of IR's processes. This will help to avoid another errata situation like the one we have with version 1.5. The more complete IR's work product is, the less the NAESB office has to handle it and, therefore, the less they can mess it up. GISB PUBLICATION PROCESS The task force that is working on the publication process (PPRTF) is picking up speed again (after the holidays). This group is addressing not only the publication process, but also the approval process for standards. We meet via conference call every Tuesday and Friday for 12 day. Our work product is due to the EC in time for their February 2002 meeting. As with IR, the results should help avoid another massive errata, as we have for version 1.5. \n",

After about 7 weeks of training and having her do intraday nominations, we put her in the weekend rotation. The first weekend she worked, it became obvious that she still d id not understand physical gas flow. Shannon spent the whole weekend on the phone talking her through any changes that needed to be made. She didn't s eem to remember anything that she had been trained on daily for the previou s 7 weeks. When I spoke to her on the following Monday, she indicated that she just became confused after someone tried to make a change in the nomina tion. We continued to work very closely with her to make her understand how physical gas flow works on El Paso. I started receiving some complaints fr om customers who were very much aware that she didn't understand what she w as doing. After several more weeks, Shannon was becoming frustrated with th e lack of progress, so I told Shannon to write down step by step every piec e of the day to day nomination and renom process. That weekend went much mo re smoothly because Liz had every step and every scenario drawn out for her . I have since had her scheduling SoCal Ehrenberg while the new people are training and that seems to be working out OK. I think the biggest problem w ith Liz is an inability to think outside the box. but she is willing to wor k hard. I hope this helps. Patti\n",

Attendees will (most likely) be: Derek Bailey Darron Giron Brad Jones Kam Keiser Errol McLaughlin Scott Palmer I anticipate starting the class the first week of October. This is a little late in the year, with the holidays, to finish by the year end, so we may need January to finish up. The meeting times will most likely be Mondays and Wednesdays from 11:30am to 1pm. The focus of the class will be learning basic programmingalgorithm techniques, using Excel and VBA as a platform, with enough real world experiences and examples to keep your interest. I would encourage you to talk with Phillip Love and Anne Bike to get their feedback on the progress of the class so far (they are about 3 weeks into the class - although the first 2 or 3 sessions are pretty dry) and the time requirements. There are bi-weekly reading assignments and exercises to complete. In addition, I will assign a few projects along the way. The time required should be very manageable unless something out of the ordinary comes up. Consider your availability. We are all busy, but I believe if you invest the time in the class it will be beneficial to you. Let me know if something in your schedule will prevent you from devoting the required time so that I can find a replacement for your slot. I haven't decided whether to purchase your textbooks myself or make everyone responsible for obtaining their own. I'll let you know when October is getting closer. Let me know if you have questions.

            "This is allegedly a true story.... To the letter of the Law !! Subject: A good lawyer story for all you cigar smokers A Charlotte, NC, lawyer purchased a box of very rare and expensive cigars, then insured them against fire among other things. Within a month having smoked his entire stockpile of these great cigars andwithout yet having made even his first premium payment on the policy, the lawyer filed a claim against the insurance company. In his claim, the lawyer stated the cigars were lost \"in a series of small fires.\" The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The lawyer sued....and won! In delivering the ruling the judge agreed with the insurance company that the claim was frivolous. The Judge stated nevertheless, that the lawyer held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that it would insure them against fire, without defining what is considered to be \"unacceptable fire,\" and was obligated to pay the claim. Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid $15,000.00 to the lawyer for his loss of the rare cigars lost in the \"fires.\" NOW FOR THE BEST PART... After the lawyer cashed the check, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of ARSON!!!! With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the lawyer was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and was sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000.00 fine.

            "this is allegedly a true story.... to the letter of the law!! subject : a good lawyer story for all you cigar smokers a charlotte, nc, lawyer purchased quite a box of very rare and expensive cigars, then insured them against fire among other things. just within a month having smoked his entire stockpile of these great cigars andwithout yet having made it even his first premium payment on the policy, the lawyer filed a claim against the insurance company. in his claim, the lawyer stated the cigars were deliberately lost \" in a series of small fires. \" the insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason : that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. the lawyer sued.... and won! in delivering the ruling the judge agreed with the insurance company that the claim was frivolous. the judge stated nevertheless, that the lawyer held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that it would insure them against fire, without defining what is considered worthy to be \" unacceptable fire, \" automatically and was obligated to pay the claim. rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid $ 15, 000. 00 to the lawyer for his loss of the rare cigars lost in the \" fires. \" now for the best part... after the police lawyer cashed the check, the insurance cover company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson!!!! with his own insurance claim certificate and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the lawyer was convicted only of intentionally burning his insured property and was sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $ 24, 000. 00 fine. this is a true story and was the 1st place winner in the recent criminal lawyers award contest.\n",

            "RSVP REQUESTED -- RSVP REQUESTED You are invited to participate in a Greenhouse Gas Strategy Discussion on November 20 to explore commercial opportunities related to greenhouse gas emissions markets. Several groups within Enron are working to monetize and integrate greenhouse-gas reduction benefits into their deals, as well as take advantage of greenhouse gas regulatory and incentive-based programs for origination, project development and risk management. The aim of the meeting is discussion -- with minimal formal presentations. We seek reactions to possible greenhouse gas commercial models; identification of barriers to market entry (and solutions); and ways that commercial groups across the company can enhance each other's capabilities to achieve commercial targets. Given the range and varying circumstances under which current greenhouse gas emissions transactions are occurring, Enron business groups should: begin to capture (define ownership and package) internal greenhouse gas reductions, look for opportunities to integrate greenhouse gas emissions concerns into existing risk management products, and Enron assets that are significant greenhouse gas emissions sources, should assess and manage exposures. DATE - TIME - LOCATION Tuesday, November 20 8:30 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. EB 8C1 Video conference and teleconference capabilities are available. Please see the attached agenda.

            "Kim, I have reviewed the language your counsel sent and have discussed it with o ur General Counsel. We can agree to remove the loss of bargain concept but not the other two damage concepts. We do not agree to the removal of \"cos t of funding\" since this can be a very real issue when a replacement transa ction requires a premium to be paid because of the off-market position. Pr emiums for such positions will have a cost of funding component. The remov al of the concept of \"loss or cost incurred as a result of terminating, liq uidating, or obtaining or reestablishing a hedge or trading position\" is al so a very real factor in calculating damages. It may very well be that the termination of a hedge is the more cost effective alternative to replacing the transaction. Furthermore, the you can obtain the same effect of termi nating a hedge by entering into an offsetting transaction (the equivalent o f a replacement transaction) rather than an outright termination with the h edge counterparty. Because the termination of a hedge is the other side of the coin, so to speak, it makes sense to leave it in the definition of Loss . We can clarify that such losses and costs are without duplication, which I think was one of your outside counsels concerns. The definition of Loss as was written is designed so that the Non-defaulting party can recover th e actual damages occasioned by the Defaulting Party's failure to perform. If the Defaulting Party objects to the Non-defaulting Party's calculation t hen such calculation would be subject to negotiation or litigation and fina l determination by a New York court. We would propose modifying your changes to read as follows: Insert the following into Part 1(e), after the period at the end thereof. \"The definition of Loss shall be amended and restated in its entirety as fo llows: \"Loss\" means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated Tran sactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency Equival ent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith and in a co mmercially reasonable manner its total losses and costs (or gain, in which case expressed as a negative number), without duplication, in connection wi th this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Tra nsactions, as the case may be, including any cost of funding or, at the ele ction of such party but without duplication, loss or cost incurred as a res ult of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading position (or any gain resulting from any of them). to be equal to the actual replacement cost to that party in entering into a re placement transaction. Loss does not include any loss of bargain, cost of funding or, loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating, liquidati ng, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading positions. Fu rthermore, Loss does not include loss of bargain, or a party's legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under Section 11. A party will dete rmine its Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if that is no t reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonab ly practicable. A party may (but need not) determine its Loss by reference to quotations of relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers in the relevant market.\" If the concept of a Replacement Value is preferable to you we are also wil ling to use the following definition, which was originally drafted by Goldm an Sachs, in lieu of the Loss definition. \"Replacement Value\" , means, with respect to each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, an amou nt that the party (the \"Determining Party\") or its agent determines in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner to be its total losses and c osts (or gains, in which case expressed as a negative number) in connection with that Terminated Transaction or group of terminated Transactions. A D etermining Party (or its agent) may determine Replacement Values for all Te rminated Transactions, any group of Terminated Transactions or individual T erminated Transactions, and may apply different valuation methods to differ ent Transactions or groups of Transactions. A Determining Party (or its a gent) will determine Replacement Values for all Terminated Transactions as of the Early Termination Date, or, if that would not be commercially reason able, as of the latest date or dates before or the earliest date or dates a fter the Early Termination Date as would be commercially reasonable under t hen prevailing circumstances. The definition of Loss would be replaced throughout the ISDA by the definit ion of Replacement Value. We hope that one of these definitions will work for you. Please call if yo u have any questions or comments on the definitions. Regards, Brent\n",

We are asking our folks not to engage in conversations or opinion related discussions about this. Also, Ken Lay will be discussing this at an employee meeting tomorrow morning. It would be a good idea for everyone to tune in, if possible (or review the playback later in the day.)

            "State lowers estimate of energy costs Consumers might see rates decrease Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau mailto:lgledhill@sfchronicle.com Saturday, October 20, 2001 ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http:www.sfgate.comcgi-binarticle.cgi?fca20011020MN39027.DTL Sacramento -- The state lowered its estimate yesterday of how much it will cost to buy power -- suggesting that lower rates could eventually be the result. Officials of the Department of Water Resources said the state will need $17. 2 billion to buy power through the end of 2002 -- about 20 percent less than previously estimated. The agency began buying power on Jan. 17 when the state's three investor- owned utilities were no longer considered credit-worthy. At the time, prices on the spot market reached upwards of $450 a megawatt hour. Now, however, prices average $30 a megawatt hour. \"Circumstances have changed,\" said Ron Nichols of Navigant Consulting, which is a consultant to the Department of Water Resources. \"Conservation has helped, we think the DWR contracts have established reliability in the market. We have broken the back of the spot market.\" Earlier this year, the state signed 56 long-term contracts with various generators to purchase power. Those contracts, which were inked when prices were at their peak, have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the PUC, and Gov. Gray Davis' administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts. But the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day. The rest comes from the spot market -- purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed. Prices on the spot market have dropped, in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive. It is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs. If the projections hold, the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue $12.5 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases. At the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs, they blasted the state Public Utilities Commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers $8 billion. Administration officials and state Treasurer Phil Angelides said a PUC decision to delay the suspension of direct access -- the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power -- will shift higher costs to smaller customers. The PUC proposed the ban on direct access in June but didn't adopt the policy until Sept. 20. During that period, the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 2 percent to 13 percent. \"What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis,\" Angelides said yesterday. He urged the PUC to reverse its decision, setting the date back to July 1. But Lorretta Lynch, president of the PUC, said the delay was at the request of the administration and the Legislature. She also objected to Angelides' numbers, saying that the PUC estimates the direct access load at 8 percent. The commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to July 1, and action will be taken at the next PUC meeting, she said. \n",

            " The paper about the Role of the Default Provider is consistent with, what I understand as Enron?s positions: it advocates for the Georgia model (the utility exiting the merchant function) and against price caps. Its main purpose is to assess the relative risks of alternative default provider models. It states that most of the risks are not inherent in the default provider models, but with other terms of restructuring (i.e., price caps). In the Atlanta Gas case, the utility was the default provider for several months, and then an alternative provider was appointed. There is no evidence of a problem with either model. However, when a default provider faces price caps below market prices, risks and inefficiencies are the likely result, regardless whether the utility or an independent merchant is the default provider. Below are the remaining conclusions: (1) Almost all consideration of default provider by the various states relates to the transition period. There is almost no consideration of default provider in the long run. (2) In most states, the local utility is the default provider and provider of last resort during the transition period. This choice appears reasonable, considering the utility's historical obligation to serve. If the local utility becomes a minor participant as a provider, the feasibility of using alternative providers for default service increases. (3) Another purpose of the paper is to link the choice of default provider to the development of competitive markets. The link is that the states' view of a competitive model influences the choice of default provider. If the perceived competitive model achieves competition at the fringe (the contestable market model, i.e. a large number of competitive providers are not essential), the local utility will remain the provider of last resort. The alternative view of the fully competitive model (effective competition between numerous providers) will result in an alternative provider being the POLR. In the case studies considered in the paper, Texas electric utilities and AGLC are exiting the merchant function. In these cases, the POLR is an alternative to the local utility. (4) The approach of AGLC to providing default service is highly successful because of its use of incentives. By exiting the merchant function within a year, AGLC created strong incentives for merchants to enter the market and attract customers. Customers had equally strong incentives to select a provider. With these incentives for customers and marketers to do business, there is little likelihood of actually needing default service. (I do not agree with this statement, but it is in our favor) (5) The rate cap provision that applies to most states is encouraging marketers to exit natural gas and electric service. This regulatory failure increases the need for a default provider and, at the same time, decreases the feasibility of obtaining default providers. A highly successful approach to a default provider is a deregulatory scheme that imparts incentives for marketers to serve customers, and thereby diminishes the need for default service. The paper mentions that Enron abandoned California market as an example that competition was not developing as expected (page 12). Please let me know if you need further details. Guille\n",

AEP's Three Year Update of its Market Based Rates As you may recall, in August, 2000, AEP filed its triennial market based rates review with FERC. On September 21, 2000 and again on October 20, 2000, EPMI protested that filing, arguing that AEP has market power in transmission so it should not be permitted to continue charging market based rates for wholesale power sales. Now, 15 months later, FERC is planning to act on the filing. \"Investigation of Terms and Conditions of Public Utility Market-Based Rate Authorizations\" This proceeding may be linked to the AEP proceeding, although the two are listed separately on FERC's agenda. While we are not certain what FERC intends to do in this docket, they could be opening up a new investigation into all market based rate authorizations, including non-utility generators and power marketers. We will monitor this closely and let you know about the proceeding as soon as we learn about it on Tuesday. Bangor Hydro vs. ISO NE Bangor Hydro filed a complaint against ISO NE on June 15, 2001 arguing that, due to a design flaw in the electronic dispatch, the ISO should reset the Energy Clearing Prices that were impacted by this design flaw from December 9, 2001 through the end of March. The ISO opposes Bangor's complaint, stating that it cannot reset prices pursuant to Market Rule 15 unless there was a specific, identifiable error and the ISO posted notice of the error within a certain time period after the error is detected. New York ISO Extension of Automated Mitigation Procedures The NYISO filed to extend its AMP until October 31, 2002. Many parties oppose the extension, others support it. New England ISO ICAP Proceeding The Commission issued an order on August 28 regarding the ICAP deficiency charge. Several parties sought rehearing. The proceeding on the agenda may be the Commission's order on those rehearing requests. ConEd's In City Mitigation ConEd filed to extend the in-city mitigation procedures through October 31, 2002. Several parties protested, others support it. Maine PUC v. ISO NE; UI v. ISO NE; Bangor Hydro v. ISO NE Several entities (Maine PUC, UI, and Bangor Hydro) filed complaints against ISO NE in August, 2000 arguing that the ISO should restate the $6,000 Energy Clearing Price that occurred on May 8, 2000. 18 months later, it looks like FERC may be ready to act on these complaints. HQ Energy v. NYISO HQ filed a compliant against the NYISO on December 12, 2000 arguing that the ISO erroneously restated the energy market clearing price for May 8, 2000. The Commission may be ready to act on this complaint as well. Because the New England complaints and HQ complaint all relate to the high energy prices that occurred on May 8, 2000, and whether the ISOs should have restated those prices, it is likely that the Commission will rule the same way in each of the proceedings (either that the ISO should have reset the prices or shouldn't have). Reliant and Mirant v. CAISO On October 18, 2001, Reliant and Mirant filed a complaint against the ISO arguing that the ISO is giving preferential treatment to the DWR and CERS and is not following the OOM tariff provisions.

In addition to the e-mail yesterday morning, I spoke in person with Gene Peters of the EPSA staff to convey our strongly held view that mere \"technical corrections\" were not enough to fix the Barton RTO proposal, as the EPSA draft letter stated. Gene came around because in a subsequent meeting we had with Rep. Chip Pickering (R-MS), a member of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, Gene said that silence would be better than what is in the Barton draft. He did indicate to me (not to Pickering) that some EPSA members, without naming them, didn't want to come down too hard on Barton because in their view the draft could have been worse. These unnamed companies (or company?) claim to have told of earlier versions not released that would have been more restrictive on FERC's discretion. Some companies also think FERC could wiggle out of the strictures of the draft. I told Gene that there is no way to wiggle out of the definitions of minimum sizescope that FERC would be forced to accept and the various procedural advantages for recalcitrant utilities. While I am checking with counterparts at other EPSA members in advance of the afternoon meeting, you might want to do the same as you speak with contacts at other EPSA members. I am confident we can get the EPSA letter to better reflect our position -- my suspicion is that the unnamed company Gene referred to is Reliant, but I can't prove it. John\n",

            " The EPSA leg. affairs cmt. met today during the fall meeting. The speakers were Howard Useem, Republican counsel to the Senate Energy Committee, and Jimmy Glotfelty, senior policy advisory to the Secretary of Energy. Useem said Senate Energy Committee Republicans were meeting later this morning to finalize their energy proposal. (We later learned that they opted against including any electricity provisions, not even the PURPA, PUHCA and reliability issues that Howard thought might be included when he spoke before the senators met; this is good news since it makes it less likely that anti-FERC provisions will be added.) (Howard said now is the best time to legislative on electricity because the Supreme Court has not yet acted on the bundlingunbundling issue.) On RTOs, in some what of a surprise, Useem said that there is general support among Senate Republicans for RTOs, including consolidating them into a few RTOs of large scope (surprising since this is not what we have heard in meetings with individual Senate offices). While he said that, he also said that support is stronger in the abstract than in specifics. He said the biggest opposition was coming from very vocal state regulators (EPSA staff did a good job of pointing to state regulators, mainly in the Midwest, who support larger RTOs). Most importantly, Howard said none of the senators on his committee take a \"not over my dead body\" approach to RTOs. Jimmy Glotfelty explained to several EPSA members who asked questions just why it is that the Administration wants Congress to be silent on RTOs. He said while they would prefer a sentence or two affirming FERC's authority, they do not believe this is what would come out of the legislative process. They are not willing to run that risk. He stressed that the president wants to include other electricity issues. He said they were very close to an agreement with Western governors on regional transmission siting. Jimmy further said that the Administration also wants silence on incentive rates, another issue where FERC can act now. They continue to talk to Barton and his staff in an attempt to get them to back away from the restrictive approach to RTOs in the Barton discussion draft. (He said Pat Wood spent several hours with Barton and other House committee staff yesterday.) Of concern, Jimmy said something like \"could be 4 RTOs, could be 8 RTOs,\" what is important is getting standard design. He also said DOE will make sure that PMAs are included in RTOs. \n",

I think it would be useful to use the specific information I have added about NY and their handling of the NYPA hydro projects in section II A. I have added some cites from RT01-12 that hopefully provide what you are looking for as far a Commission statements about the number of RTOs. There are some other miscellanous comments as well. In the conclusion, I know our position has always been against penalties as it relates to things like ancillary services, but philosophically speaking I thought it may be beneficial to include some language which would allow the Commission some explict actions it could take if RTO compliance (started on time) was not met. Otherwise I can just see them (the commission) drawing lines in the sand over and over again, like Dec 15, 2001 and the utilities just continuing being passive agressive. Just a thought.

We knew that the CPUC was at a minimum going to investigate how andor whether to allow extensions of contracts and the application of other surcharge $$ to DA load given their earlier statements. The issue on retroactivity is open primarily because they can ask these questions and (I believe) as leverage for other issues. 3. We are coordinating with the big customers who recently left. They are marshalling forces to oppose any retroactivity. This is as much their fight as it is ours. 4. At this time, Enron will file as a member of AReM. We intend to oppose the CPUC's request for our contracts and transaction information. If you want any other info or want to discuss further, let me know. Jim\n",

Mark Bonney (Manager, RAC) and I were on two panels and led a discussion of a short case (theme: proposed new power plant in U.S.) during the Enron-sponsored lunch. Although Enron's current difficulties were not raised by any student (the Finance Club had recommended against bringing the events of last week up), they were raised by a professor during the second panel. Mark and I did our best to put LJM and other current issues in perspective. After lunch, one student summed up the apparent sentiments of all.

            "Victor -- This is just a brief note to memorialize our earlier conversation today. You had asked me whether there were any regulatory impediments to Enron renegotiating the Ada contract with Consumers so as to increase the v alue of the deal to our mutual benefit. Specifically, you inquired whether changing the PPA to permit us to source the power used to comply with tour obligations under the contract from the market. The changes you recommend to make to the PPA would not change the rate paid by Consumers but rather, the sourcing requirement. My preliminary assessment is that such PPA changes would not need to be filed for approval at the PSC. I have several reasons why the above mentioned changes would likely not hav e to be approved by the Commission. First, rate increases must be subject to hearings and approval by the Commission. Consumers has a frozen purcha sed powerfuel adjustment clause and any changes in its contracts could not be passed on to customers during the term for which that rate is frozen. S ince the rate could not increase, there would be no chance to pass through to customers a rate increase hence, no requirement to seek approval. Moreo ver, after Consumers' fuelpurchased power adjustment clause is reinstated , we could reneotiate the contract downwards and pass on a small savings (a gain, a rate decrease)to customers and we and Consumers could split the lio n's share of the savings revenue. Lastly, but more significantly, the Mich igan law that pertains to utilities recovering QF costs through rates only provides authority to the Commission to review PPA changes if the costs for power and energy increase. Our proposed changes are not likely to be deem ed to be a rate increase. Generally an unchanged rate for a service with a declining quality of service ( e.g., a firm transport service changed to a n interruptible service at the same rate)could be construed as a rate incre ase thus triggering the Commission's authority. Our proposal is quite diff erent from that instance because, as I understand it, the change we propose would only affect our power sourcing ability and that Consumers would rema in able to call on the Ada unit's capacity at all times if needed. If chan ged as described, Consumers will receive the full quality and quantity of s ervice for which it contracted under the PPA so its rights seem undisturbed . The only change we seek is for Enron to have an option for power sourcin g, which should be \"invisible\" to Consumers -- except for the check we pro vide them as inducement. I look forward to meeting with you Friday of this week to discuss this matt er more fully.\n",

            "Mike: Comments looks good. My only comment is that, in our view, the price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is simply bad economic policy and won't address any problems--in fact it will only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I'm not even sure that the Commission can successfully \"regulate\" prices in the secondary market.) Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision based comments advising against them? Very unlikely. But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause. I think that it's very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on record against them. That said, I don't want the comments to be so negative as to cloud support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the cap based on our comments. Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on. Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are ill-advised? Best, Jeff \n",

            "The Ministry of Environment in Ontario released its final emissions trading regulation yesterday. Based on a quick review, several changes were made that Enron asked for in its submission earlier this month. Specifically: OPG's allocations will be partitioned through 2007 (not 2010) Allowances will be allocated on a prospective basis, baned on the previous year's generation (output). Estimations of energy production will be used (subject to a true-up) to accommodate new generators which come on line during a compliance year. Direction and distance provisions that would discount emissions reductions credits (foreign allowances) have been removed. The SO2 set aside for renewable energy and energy efficiency is raised to 4 KT (NOx --expressed as NO - remains at 1 KT). There is no restriction on banking of credits. ERC credit lifetime extended from five to seven years. Approval of ERCs by the Ministry of the Environment before registration of the credits (rather than after registration but before use). Please see the summary of the regulation below compiled by Lisa DeMarco of Donahue Ernst Young in Toronto. Environmental Strategies will analyze the regulation and be back in touch with more information on its impact for Enron. Do not hesitate to contact me with any questions. Link to MOE summary of regulation changes and links to regulation: http:204.40.253.254envregistry016576er.htm On October 24, 2001, the Ontario Minister of Environment released the final emissions trading regulation which includes several significant changes to the draft regulation. The release of this regulation and an additional regulation governing emissions from the Lakeview generating station is broadly thought to signify the likely opening of the Ontario electricity market in Spring, 2002 (please see attached article). A brief overview of the central aspects of the Ontario emissions trading regulation, which sets out a hybrid (\"Cap, Credit and Trade\") system of emissions trading for Ontario, follows Applicability: Starting in 2002, the regulation will apply to Ontario Power Generation's (\"OPG\") 6 fossil fuel generating stations. In 2004, the requirements will be extended to large (25MW) Independent Power Producers (\"IPPs\") in the province. Most notably, the regulation is accompanied by an announcement that caps and the associated hybrid trading scheme will be extended to other major industrial sectors in the near future. Consultation with those sectors regarding the level of their sector caps will commence immediately. Caps: NOx (measured as NO): An overall cap of 36 KT in 2002 will decline to 28 KT in 2010. The cap will be partitioned between OPG and IPPs between 2004 and 2007. Each year renewable and energy conservation projects will be eligible for 1 KT of \"set-aside\" allowances. Starting in 2007, the allocation of allowances will also be subject to a NorthSouth partition to comply with obligations under the Ozone Annex to the Canada US A Air Quality Agreement. Trading between these areas is not, however, restricted. SO2: An overall cap of 157.5 KT in 2002 will decline to 131 KT in 2007. The cap will not be partitioned between OPG and IPPs and will apply to OPG facilities in 2002 and all large IPPs in 2004. Each year renewable and energy conservation projects will be eligible for 4 KT of \"set-aside\" allowances. Allocation: Prospective allocation of allowances will be on the basis of a facility's pro-rata share of energy production (output) in the province. OPG will receive a corporate based allocation each year until the end of 2007, at which point all allocations will be on a facility basis. The proposed mechanism allows for estimations of energy production to be used (subject to a true-up) to accommodate new generators which come on line during a compliance year. Measurement of emissions must be by CEMs or equivalent technology. Credit Creation: Emission reduction credits (\"credits\") may be created in accordance with MOE \"Standard Methods\" from baseline project emission rates in the year prior to creation. Specific requirements are set out in the Ontario Emissions Trading Code (\"OETC\"). Generally credits may be created from any of the following jurisdictions: Ontario, New York, Pennsylvania, New jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia (with possible science-based extension of the eligible jurisdictions) In addition, US allowances which are issued by these jurisdictions may be acceptable for use as Ontario credits if they meet the requirements set out in the OETC. Early action credits may be eligible for use if they: meet the requirements of the OETC; were submitted for review by the PERT program before July 1, 2001; and were created between July 1, 1998 and January 1, 2000. Credits will be approved for use by the MOE before they are registered on the Emissions Trading Registry. Credit and Allowance Use: Use of credits is limited to 33% of allowances used for NOx and 10% of allowances used for SO2. These limits do not apply if the facility is operating under an IMO must run contract. All credits will be subject to a 10% environmental discount. The ratio of smog season to non-smog season NOx credits must reflect the same ratio of actual emissions. There is no restriction on banking of credits. There is no distance and directionality discounting for the eligible jurisdictions. Trading There is generally unrestricted trading through the Ontario Emissions Trading Registry. \n",

            "As described in my August 22 e-mail, FERC has issued a NOPR proposing revised public utility filing requirements. A copy of my Aug. 22 summary is attached for your reference. I've discussed this with Elizabeth Sager and Harlan Murphy in ENA Legal, and the following is a very brief summary of aspects of the NOPR that we think Enron should consider opposing. Comments are due Oct. 5. If approved, FERC's proposed revisions would affect Enron by requiring electronic posting of certain transactional data by power marketers and entities selling at wholesale pursuant to market-based rate authority. Currently, EPMI (and gencos with market-based rate authority) must file the following information quarterly: - identification of the buyerseller; - description of the service, (e.g., purchasesale, firmnon-firm); - delivery point(s); - price(s) (price per transaction rather than price ranges) - quantities, (e.g., MWhMW); and - datesduration of service (e.g., daily, monthly, hourly, etc.) Such information is supposed to be reported on a transaction by transaction (rather than aggregated) basis. The quarterly filings are paper filings and are not granted confidential treatment. The quarterly filing requirements proposed in the NOPR differ in that they would, 1) in addition to all of the above information, also require posting of the transaction execution date and the point of receipt; 2) require electronic posting of an Index of Customers rather than paper filing and 3) require reporting for all sales transactions including book outs or net outs. Enron should consider objecting to these revisions. I've spoken with some of the traders and they agree. The effect of these requirements would be that Enron's competitors will now have quicker, easier access to not only the usual reported information but also to the transaction execution date which will disclose a place and time for the transaction. FERC has cited very little valid justification for imposing these new requirements. ENA Legal representatives and I will be participating in the EPSA conference call to discuss the NOPR on Friday. I would like to have a consensus on Enron's general position by then. I do not know whether we will be joining EPSA's comments or filing on our own.

            "as described in my august 22 e - mail, ferc has issued a nopr proposing revised public utility filing requirements. a copy of my aug. 22 summary is attached for your reference. i've discussed this with elizabeth sager and harlan murphy in ena legal, and the following is a very brief summary of aspects of the nopr that we think enron should consider opposing. comments are due oct. 5. if approved, ferc's proposed revisions would affect enron by requiring electronic posting of certain transactional data by power marketers and entities selling at wholesale pursuant to market - based rate authority. currently, epmi ( and gencos with market - based rate authority ) must file the following information quarterly : - identification of the buyerseller ; - description of the service, ( e. g., purchasesale, firmnon - firm ) ; - delivery point ( s ) ; - price ( s ) ( price per transaction rather than price ranges ) - quantities, ( e. g., mwhmw ) ; and - datesduration of service ( e. g., daily, monthly, hourly, etc. ) such information is supposed to be reported on a transaction by transaction ( rather than aggregated ) basis. the quarterly filings are paper filings and are not granted confidential treatment. the quarterly filing requirements proposed in the nopr differ in that they would, 1 ) in addition to all of the above information, also require posting of the transaction execution date and the point of receipt ; 2 ) require electronic posting of an index of customers rather than paper filing and 3 ) require reporting for all sales transactions including book outs or net outs. enron should consider objecting to these revisions. i've spoken with some of the traders and they agree. the effect of these requirements would be that enron's competitors will now have quicker, easier access to not only the usual reported information but also to the transaction execution date which will disclose a place and time for the transaction. ferc has cited very little valid justification for imposing these new requirements. ena legal representatives and i will be participating in the epsa conference call to discuss the nopr on friday. i would like to have a consensus on enron's general position by then. i don't know whether we will be joining epsa's comments or filing on our own. please let me know only your thoughts and call me if you would like to discuss. also, if you don't already have information on the epsa conference call and want to participate, let me know and i can provide you with the call - in number and agenda. ssl\n",

            "Good mark ups. Thanks. Originally, I purposely excluded acknowledging the need for a forum to develop non-physicalpure financial standards. I was not sure if this was an issue we could win buy-in from other marketers that NERC establish business practices. However, on the EPSA-NAERO Working Group conference call today, one member suggested we alert NERC and FERC to the fact that \"business practices\" have the hardest impact on the marketers and IPPs. And if NERC is going there - then the likes of EPSA and ELCON become the major staekholders in that forum. I think this is a great twist to the old \"reliablity first approach\" of NERC and can give us major leverage. I will bolster this point in the write-up. EPSA will draft a letter to be sent to Mike Gent explaining what EPSA members support. It will be based upon a \"checklist\" of issues similar to this write-up. I would like to get this write-up into Mark Bennett's hands to incorporate into the letter and see if other EPSA members can support it. We may still want to send this write-up directly to Dave Nevius and Mike Gent since, they approached us directly. Additionally, EPSA members agreed that we should continue the parallel development of EISB and NERC. But - take an active role in the formation of the 4th quadrant of EISB. DOE has offered to host a forum for an industry effort to kick-start the 4th quadrant. Mark Bennett has been talking with Rae McQuade at GISB and she told him that NERC, as an organization, cannot be folded under the EISB umbrella. FERC would have liked such a simple solution, they want the expertiseexperience of NERC - and the fair process of GISB. So, the challenge is a) migrate the NERC expertise into the EISB, or b) transform the NERC structure into an EISB like structure NERC is proceeding at Warp Factor 10 in making a transition into the new One-Stop Shop. EPSA members believe that NERC leading this charge will certainly result in the marketers geting the short endf as we did with the Blue Ribbon Panel of a few years ago. EPSA members want an open and inclusive forum for shaping the new organization. That is the justification for participating in the DOE sponsored forum - to challenge NERC leading this charge. This concern will also be expressed in the EPSA letter. \n",

Southern's CEO testified in Congress recently that their load is over 35,000. I assume the 40,000 MW minimum would permit the SeTrans proposal to meet the proposed statutory minimum since it is Southern plus a few munis, as I understand it. Is this correct? Who would know how many RTOs there would be if each were just over the 40,000 MW minimum? I assume it is much more than 4-5 RTOs -- if so, this is a good contrast to use in our Hill efforts.

            "Northeast RTO Mediation Report The Commissioners heard a report from the ALJ who presided over the Northea st RTO mediation. As you may recall, the Judge did not support our positio n (which was to get a single Northeast RTO up and running, with PJM leaders hip and based on the PJM system) by no later than November 2003 (the PJM pr oposal). As expected, the Judge reiterated his disagreement with the PJM p roposal and urged the Commission to take a \"go slower\" approach that includ es a minimum 12 month up-front assessment of technology and \"best practices \" determinations. Pat Wood first questioned why the Board makeup should consist of existing I SO board members. He acknowledged that the existing ISO board members have experience but questioned whether the benefit of having their experience i s outweighed by the possibility of continued parochial interests that may b e retained by these board members. He thinks perhaps the board should be m ade up of totally new board members. Ironically, in the mediation only a c ouple of consumer advocate-types supported this type of approach. Everyone else believed that using the existin ISO board members makes more sense si nce they all have experience. We supported a board makeup weighted in favo r of PJM so that implementation of the PJM system would be assured. Pat se ems to think this presents too much of a political problem. Pat also expressed concern that FERC not take action that would upset the e xisting, functioning markets. He said FERC should not force a result if it does not know what the outcome will be and could disrupt the existing mark ets. He questioned whether they should take a different, slower approach i n the northeast, perhaps putting some regional functions into place soon (e .g., interregional transmission planning and expansion) and put off other i ssues (a single real time balancing market) that may be harder to implement at first. Pat says that technology assessment is a big issue and can be a show stopper if it is not done correctly. Under the PJM proposal, the new RTO would form by the end of the year and would start market design (based on the PJM system) immediately. Doing an upfront assesment could delay im plementation significantly. He said perhaps some things can be done sooner than 18-24 months. If he is thinking that long-term is 18-24 months, then we could be okay because the PJM plan takes 24 months to implement. But, his statements on technical assessment are troubling and sound like he may be willing to delay the startup of market design until this takes place. On the positive side, Nora Brownell reminded everyone that New York and PJM have very similar systems but they have a lot of problems working together and that these problems may be a hindrance to the developing retail market s. She seems to think that things cannot remain as they are. Nothing was decided and it is unclear when FERC will issue an order in this proceeding. We will keep you posted. Sarah\n",

Before I turn to the organizational changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t he company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are b y their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of t his group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re sponsibility. This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat ed group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also very decent and good people. To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is not easy. I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor k, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we shared. I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special. Thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done. As to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun ctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times. The nee d to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all U.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective. As a result, Jim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j ointly report to Jim and myself.

With the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our politicalleg islative needs across the U.S. Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w ill address that need and that will focus on state political support. Paul will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev elopment efforts across the U.S. Much of the rest of the group remains the same. Linda Robertson will conti nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.

Maggy Huson will take over su pport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market s, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.

Paul Dawson, who heads up government affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout h America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts , will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.

            "Dear All, Attached is the ordinance with my amendments. 1. Requiring REPs to register with the city within 15 days from date of certification is too restrictive. It will put a burden on a REP to register with the city, before it registers with utilities or even before it determines whether or not it will market within the city of Coppel. In the likely event that more cities enact an ordinance, a REP will face great pressure to register with them all within 15 days of certification, and while also arranging registration with utilities. Finally, it may bar a REP who wants to market to customers within the city after 15 days of certification, unless it had registered previously. 2. I do not think that $500 per day is a reasonable penalty, especially for REPs serving residential customers. By the time a complaint is resolved, a REP could be looking at a lot of money. The timeline for investigating a slamming complaint in the Customer Protection Rules is a good example Additional Questions How will a finding of \"significant violation\" be determined. Who will make the determination. What is the process. When does the penalty kick in.

            "dear all, attached is the ordinance with my amendments. 1. this requiring reps to register with the city within 15 days from date of certification is too restrictive. so it will put a burden on a rep to register with the city, before it registers with utilities or even before it determines whether or not it will market within the city of coppel. in the least likely event that more cities enact an ordinance, a rep will face great pressure to register with customers them all within 15 days of certification, and while also arranging registration with more utilities. finally, it may bar a rep who never wants to market to customers within the city after 15 days of certification, unless it had registered previously. 2. i don't think that $ 500 per day is a reasonable penalty, especially for reps serving residential customers. by the time a complaint is resolved, a significant rep situation could be looking at a lot of money. the timeline for investigating of a slamming complaint in the customer protection rules committee is a good example additional questions how will a finding of \" significant violation \" be determined. who will make the determination. what is the process. when does the penalty kick in. if the determination of \" significant violation \" is made by the city, what if the commission determines differently? given the legislative intent discussed at the last meeting, should there be a requirement that a complaint to the puc within a time frame allowing for resolution precede any determination by the city? please call with any questions, gloria ogenyi 713 - 345 - 8202\n",

            "JimLuiz, The EPSA filing generally addresses the same issues that the filing we've prepared does, although our draft treats independencegovernance, tariff administration, congestion managementancillary services, and planning expansion in much greater detail. When I put together an initial draft in late October (before the filing deadline was postponed until November 28), I shared it with Erin and talked with her about the EPSA draft at that time. Her intent was to deal very generally with the issues. As a result, the current EPSA draft is not as focused as it might be. For example, at pages 5-6 EPSA appropriately criticizes the makeup of the independent board -- but in taking a swipe at the ARTO stakeholder process, suggests implicitly that there is a parallel between the ARTO and Translink board makeups. At page 6 EPSA takes a strong position vis a vis divestiture, arguing that independence is compromised if TOs are permitted to sign leases or operating agreements to transfer functional responsibility for transmission assets to the ITC. I can't argue with the purity of the position, but of course FERC endorses passive ownership -- which EPSA acknowledges in its discussion later in the paragraph regarding the \"three key elements to consider for passive ownership of RTO market participants.\" Then EPSA goes on to identify only two of these three key elements. Another place in the draft that suffers from some sloppiness is the discussion of operational authority at pages 8 and 9. As a reader I'm not sure whether EPSA's complaint is with non-jurisdicitonal utilities retaining direct control over their transmission operations, or that Translink has not demonstrated that it has sufficient scope and configuration to exercise the operational protocols it has proposed. In any event, the paragraph at pages 8-9 introduces both ideas in a disjointed manner. One other example that might rise above nit-picking -- at page 9 EPSA states that the Commission stated in the Mediation Report for the Southeast RTO that all ITC planning recommendations should be subject to review and approval by the RTO. As you know this was the recommendation to the Commission by the ALJ. To sum up, I think we generally agree with the message -- I just wouldn't have said it that way. You'll recall that I sent out an initial draft on Transco in late October. Competitive Coalition participants also received the draft, and by late tomorrow I'm expecting feedbacksuggestions on that draft -- to include a section explaining that the Translink filing does not meet standards for Appendix I filings, as well as an argument about which functions ITCs (any ITC, not just Translink) should be able to exercise and which should be in the RTOs domain. I will circulate those suggestions for review. If we don't agree, then we will not file with the Coalition although they will still likely use the bulk of what I previously prepared regarding the legal analysis of FERC's previous statements regarding ITCs. I think I sent this to you before -- the intial draft that was shared with EPSA and the Competitive Coalition. \n",

None of us underestimates the difficulty of this in an election year. Speaking of elections, we may also want to contact the Riordan campaign. He came out with some good messages on energy but did not say a peep about retail competition. To the extent we can make it an issue in the campaign, it gets more visibility. We should also consider pushing on John White and company to make green DA a reality. Some DA is better than none. The fee and rules issue is going to be a grind and likely at the CPUC. As I've said, it's been hand-to-hand combat with the utilities since 9-20-01. I would like to find a way to work better with the customer groups, because in the end, they are the ones who can carry the day. Nobody really wants to listen to a bunch of ESPs. The problem is that no one really cares as much as we do -- it's our business afterall. I can't make any promises about Enron or EnronDynegy continuing in AReM and I can't predict ifwhen we might bow out. I think AReM is going to have to pick its spots this year and minimize its expenses whatever it does. Unfortunately, our experience at the CPUC has been bad. That would argue for a minimum of activity in the cases and a maximum of lobbying at the Commission and the LegAdmin. We have to remember that we get all excited about these cases and the issues only to be ignored or harmed when decisions are reached -- especially with certain ALJs.

My reply was this \"logic\" was like saying we should be grateful he shot us in the head instead of hanging us -- one method may be more \"humane\" but either way we are \"dead\" (OK, the analogy may be too rough -- but it made the point.) (I subsequently confirmed that Reliant is the \"soft\" member -- their rep. told me they \"support the discussion draft although they wouldn't object if it is strengthened.\") A stronger EPSA letter with more specific reasons why we oppose the Barton discussion draft will be circulated among EPSA members today or Monday, with the goal of sending the letter first thing Tuesday when Congress returns. Some wanted a general letter requesting a meeting, and deferring specific comments until the meeting. I pointed out that Barton is speaking to subcommittee members right now and that we needed to copy them on a more detailed letter ASAP so they hear from us before Barton gets to them. We will make the same contacts ourselves. In fact, we have already started. Spoke to Reps. Chip Pickering and Rep. Greg Walden, both subcommittee Republicans, this week (did same with staff to Rep.

The group includes IOGA (an ass ociation of oil gas suppliers in PA), TXU, Hess, New Power, and 4 others. Moody successfully got a postponement of the payments until Oct 16. EES is included in the postponement at this time. The options are to litigate the assessment (Moody feels we are on solid ground to prevail) or to negoti ate a settlement with the PUC where we agree to some assessment to be deter mined. Litigating the assessment could cost about $50K - $60K (in addition to the $25K to date) whereas settling would obviously be less expensive in itially but would provide an assessment for each year going forward. Moody id meeting with the PA PUC this Friday to determine what would be the best way to proceed (he is hoping to convince them that the statute is quite cl ear that they cannot make the assessment and that they withdraw it). We wi ll have a better grasp of the situation and clearer path for the direction we should pursue after that meeting. I will keep you informed. \n",

            "Jim, WSCC is voting on the formation of the WECC which will consolidated WSCC with the Western Regional Transmission Association and the Southwest Regional Transmission Association. The Northwest Regional Transmission Association is likely to follow. In order for this proposal to pass, 85% of the members must vote in favor and 90% of the control area MWs. I think we should be there to vote for approval of the proposal. In addition to combining the three (and possibly four) organizations, the change will alter the board make up, bringing independent members onto the board and allowing more latitude in membership. The committees will be reevaluated as well and restructured over then next 2-3 years. Ray Alvarez is the member of the Board, so I talked to him about coverage. He seemed to be uncertain about his availability. I have an RTO West Congestion Management Meeting, where we are closing in on the final details of a financial rights model based on nodal pricing in real time. I think I need to be there to keep the thing from getting fouled up. Dave is close in Phoenix, so that was the reason that we tentatively made a reservation for him at the hotel. Steve \n",

            "Bob, Per Section 25.345 (c) of the Electric rules, if the Cogen facility has a rated capacity of 10MW or less, it qualifies as \"eligible generation\" under Section 25.345(c)(B). In Section 25.345(i), an end-user whose actual load is lawfully served by eligible generation and who does not receive any electrical service that requires the delivery of power through the facilities of a T D utility is not responsible for payment of any stranded cost charges. Also a retail customer whose actual load is lawfully served by eligible generation who also receives electrical service that require the delivery of power through the facilities of a T D utility, shall be responsible for payment of stranded costs charges based solely on the services that are actually provided by the T D utility. The short answers to your questions are: 1. Rock Tenn will not be required to pay CTC charges if its rated output is less than 10MW, and it does not take any TD services from TXU. 2. If Rock Tenn uses TD facilities occasionally, it will pay CTC only for the actual services it receives from the T D utility. 3. If Rock Tenn completely disconnects from the utilities TD services, it will be in the same position as in 1 above. It will not be required to pay the CTC. 4. At this time, TXU does not have a financing bond issued by the Commission. In an earlier order, the Commission approved $363 MM for TXU, but that order was appealed, and the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Commission for rehearing. With information that is available to it at this time, the Commission does not think that TXU has stranded costs. I believe TXU will disagree. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.

            "FYI. If I've missed anyone who might be interested, please forward along. Best, Jeff CALIFORNIA ENERGY MARKETS Friday, October 19, 2001 1 Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash After a three-month honeymoon, the new California Power Authority is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the Legislature looking into its deals, the California Energy Commission annoyed with its monopolizing ventures and the Department of Water Resources rebuffing its plan to sell its power through state contracts. Other than skepticism from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and fuel cells at 18. 18 Assembly to Investigate Power Authority (from 1) Is the California Power Authority a dangerously out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting back some state control over electricity supplies? The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the Power Authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal authors of the Power Authority's enabling legisla-tion, SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the Energy Foundation's unpaid role in devel-oping the Power Authority's requests for bids, particularly the RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany, Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps between Capstone and the Energy Foundation. Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority. Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and heads of other agencies the Power Authority must work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose Power Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed Power Authority board chair David Freeman's pro-posal to have it buy peaker output. California Energy Commission members said they are at policy odds with the Power Authority's siting plans. In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said that the Power Authority's power-wind and fossil peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not able to respond quickly enough to balancing power needs. \"The letters of intent already approved by the Power Authority could far exceed DWR's ability to ab-sorb that power given the outlook for net-short need.\" Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority power will be via contract, not the spot market. \"Selling on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky,\" said Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha. The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently in the position of actually being able to acquire new energy as the state's $12.5 billion bond issue to underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in limbo and the California Independent System Operator is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic house in order, and an Assembly investigation might jeopardize that J.A. Savage. \n",

EPSA realizes that circulating its paper on market based rates probably does not make sense now that the Commission has noticed this proceeding, but they are prepare a press release for Lynn Church to release if, after seeing what the Commission has in mind, the investigation will apply to all holders of market based rates. The press release will state that an investigation of the entire industry is overbroad, and (assuming the Commission makes all market based rates subject to refund during the investigation) that a refund obligation will introduce even more uncertainty into the industry than already exists. I have a call in to EPSA to see if I can get any more details about what the press release will say. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for the press release.

            "i personally sat in on the epsa call on market based rates on friday. as you know, the commission has on its agenda for tomorrow a new proceeding entitled \" investigation of terms and conditions of annual public utility market - based rate exemption authorizations \" ( presumably being done under the commission's section 206 authorization ). epsa realizes that circulating its paper on market based rates probably does not make sense now that the commission has noticed this proceeding, but they are prepare a press release for lynn church to release if, after seeing what the commission has in mind, the investigation request will apply to all holders each of each market based rates. the press release will state that an investigation of the entire industry is overbroad, and ( assuming the commission makes all market based rates subject to refund during the investigation ) that a refund obligation will introduce even more uncertainty into the industry than already exists. tomorrow i have a call in to epsa to see if i can get any more details about what the press release will say. please let me know if you have any questions asked or suggestions for handling the press conference release. i'll let everyone know what comes out of the ferc meeting as soon as i find out. sarah\n",

            "As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd. This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002. I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below. Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26. In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible. Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product. Main argument: Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows \"marketer firm\" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources. Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation \"owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,\" and 2) a Network Customer \"must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract\" in order to designate a Network Resource. Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource: - permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems - Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation - allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity - since retail providers are allowed to rely on \"over-the-counter\" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources. It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

            "paperloop.com SAN FRANCISCO, July 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Various major market pulp producers have further increased their downtime plans -- scheduling an estimated 767,402 tonnes during the third quarter -- in a more aggressive attempt to bring inventories in line with expected demand. Many of the supply curtailments are taking place during the summer as producers anticipate continued weak pricing. The 767,402 tonnes producers are taking this quarter represent the most downtime producers have taken in the past fiscal year, and already has eclipsed the estimated 655,132 tonnes producers took in the second quarter. The total also dwarfed the 383,000 tonnes taken in the first quarter, when cold weather prevented some producers from shutting operations, and has surpassed the 512,000 tonnes taken in fourth-quarter 2000, when several producers combined maintenance and market-related shuts. Current downtime is primarily market related, say industry sources. Tembec, Inc., which has about 426,000 tonnes of yearly northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) capacity, will lose about 20,119 tonnes from its NBSK mill in Skookumchuck, B.C., while its other NBSK mill, in Smooth Rock Falls, Ont., will trim about 16,926 tonnes based on c capacity of 191,000 tonnesyr. Tembec's NBSK downtime alone will total 37,405 tonnes, representing more than a third of the 100,000 tonnes of 3Q downtime it has planned. The remaining 62,595 tonnes will come from its various bleached chemi-thermomechanical (BCTMP) mills and some specialty sulfite pulps. A source at Parsons Whittemore today said the Rye Brook, N.Y., firm would shutter its northern bleached hardwood kraft (NBHK) mill in Nackawick, N.B., from Aug. 20 to Sept. 8. The mill, which has capacity to produce 260,000 tonnesyr, will curb about 14,060 tonnes from its supplies. All of the downtime is market-related, said the source. Meanwhile, International Paper Co. said during a conference call last week that its third-quarter pulp curtailments would total about 80,000 tonnes, equaling the downtime it had taken in the second quarter. That downtime is in addition to huge cutbacks of a combined 147,000 tonnes per quarter it has taken since shutting down its integrated pulp mills in Mobile, Ala., and Camden, Ark. Canfor Corp. last week said it would close its Northwood mill in Prince George, B.C., from July 27-Aug. 6 and lose about 19,000 tonnes of NBSK. A company source said the mill would again close in September, with its two pulp lines shut for about 10 days each, losing another 15,000 tonnes and bringing the company's third-quarter NBSK downtime to 34,000 tonnes, according to the source. Valois Vision Marketing reported last week that UPM-Kymmene has taken about 12,000 tonnes of NBSK from supplies at its Miramichi, N.B., mill in July. Further third-quarter downtime plans at the firm were not available. \"Look at the prices, I'm surprised there isn't more downtime,\" said Managing Director Michel Valois, who expected that paper downtime would continue at a high rate.

            "paperloop. com san francisco, july 27, 2001 ( paperloop. com ) - various major market pulp producers have further increased their downtime plans - - scheduling an estimated 767, 402 tonnes during the third quarter - - in a more aggressive attempt to bring inventories in line with expected demand. many of the supply curtailments are taking place during the summer as producers anticipate continued weak pricing. the 767, 402 tonnes producers are taking this quarter represent the most downtime producers have taken in the past fiscal year, and already has eclipsed the estimated 655, 132 tonnes producers took in the second quarter. the total also dwarfed the 383, 000 tonnes taken in the first quarter, when cold weather prevented some producers from shutting operations, and has surpassed the 512, 000 tonnes taken in fourth - quarter 2000, when several producers combined maintenance and market - related shuts. current downtime is primarily market related, say industry sources. tembec, inc., which has about 426, 000 tonnes of yearly northern bleached softwood kraft ( nbsk ) capacity, will lose about 20, 119 tonnes from its nbsk mill in skookumchuck, b. c., while its other nbsk mill, in smooth rock falls, ont., will trim about 16, 926 tonnes based on c capacity of 191, 000 tonnesyr. tembec's nbsk downtime alone will total 37, 405 tonnes, representing more than a third of the 100, 000 tonnes of 3q downtime it has planned. the remaining 62, 595 tonnes will come from its various bleached chemi - thermomechanical ( bctmp ) mills and some specialty sulfite pulps. a source at parsons whittemore today said the rye brook, n. y., firm would shutter its northern bleached hardwood kraft ( nbhk ) mill in nackawick, n. b., from aug. 20 to sept. 8. the mill, which has capacity to produce 260, 000 tonnesyr, will curb about 14, 060 tonnes from its supplies. all of the downtime is market - related, said the source. meanwhile, international paper co. said during a conference call last week that its third - quarter monthly pulp curtailments would total about 80, 000 tonnes, equaling the downtime it had taken in the second quarter. that downtime is in addition to huge cutbacks of a combined 147, 000 tonnes per quarter it has taken since shutting down its integrated pulp mills in mobile, ala., and camden, ark. canfor corp. last week said it would close its northwood mill in prince george, b. c., from july 27 - aug. 6 and lose about 19, 000 tonnes of nbsk. a company source said the mill would again close in september, with its two pulp lines shut for about 10 days each, losing another 15, 000 tonnes and bringing the company's third - quarter nbsk downtime to 34, 000 tonnes, according to the source. valois vision marketing reported last week that upm - kymmene has taken about 12, 000 tonnes of nbsk from supplies at its miramichi, n. b., mill in july. further third - quarter downtime plans at the firm were not available. \" look at the prices, i'm surprised there isn't more downtime, \" said managing director michel valois, who expected that paper downtime would continue at a high rate. that could fuel additional market pulp downtime moving forward, he noted.\n",

            "paperloop.com BRUSSELS, Aug. 9, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) prices settled at $460tonne for regular business during the past week as $480tonne disappeared into the sunset. Speculation about where levels will end up next puts the price at $440-450tonne by the end of the month. There are reports that some contract business has already been concluded at $450tonne. Norscan inventory figures for July are awaited eagerly. One supplier asserted that a reasonable drop in Norscan stocks would be enough to hold the price of NBSK at $460tonne. Downtime in British Columbia, Canada, has been particularly strong and there are hopes that this will tug down the Norscan inventories. Stocks of pulp at European ports dropped by 44,000 tonnes from June to July, according to Europulp's figures. FOEX showed a slide in the price of NBSK of over $10tonne to $458.92tonne on August 7 from the previous week's $469.23tonne. Eucalyptus and birch declined from Euro 458.30tonne to Euro 449.08tonne during the same period. Many price agreements for regular business over the past few weeks have covered July and August. While this can be attributed to the mid-year vacation period effect - any price movement would be irrelevant in Italy in August, for example - market makers believe that a genuine flattening out has occurred and that a period of stability can be expected, albeit at rock bottom prices. Softwood pulp remains available in Europe for spot deals, although the regular price is so close to the spot price that buyers are more likely to be pestered by their regular suppliers than by one-off deal makers. What little Canadian NBSK that is available on the European spot market is priced at around $400tonne. This is rather more than the Scandinavian equivalent, which has arrived on the market thanks to the over-production which June's Norscan figures revealed. Much of this pulp, which is available at some $20-30tonne cheaper than Canadian NBSK, has found its way to Asia and the Middle East to compete for government tenders. The Pulpex August 2001 NBSK contract closed up $10.25 at $407.5tonne DDU net the week ending August 3. Pulpex is not an exact mirror of the spot market but has proved a useful barometer and this rise suggests that there is at least little further downward pressure on spot prices. One supplier believes that a period of restocking by buyers can be expected in September, as just-in-time purchasing in the expectation of further price cuts would no longer be necessary. This would in reality be nothing but a shift of inventory from supplier to buyer. Only a rejuvenated paper market can drag market pulp out of its trough and there is no guarantee that buyers will have the liquidity to increase their stocks even if they wish to. One of the more optimistic analysts said, \"The fundamentals are not there for a price increase before October.\" \n",

In summary, DRIWEFA believes that the economy will experience a deeper downturn than previously forecast, reaching a low during the second quarter of 2002. Following this bottom, they expect the economy to experience a sharp \"V\" recovery in 2003, reaching levels that are comparable to the second half of 2000, driven by fiscal stimuli from US government and monetary stimuli from the Federal Reserve. They expect the world economy to follow the US pattern of growth, although some countries may experience slower growth rates . DRIWEFA has made the following baseline assumptions (probability 50-60%): There will be no more terrorist attacks in the near future; US counter-attacks will have no permanent negative impact on confidence or oil prices; Consumer and business confidence will recover after three to four months; Oil prices will remain weak; and More fiscal and monetary stimuli are in the pipeline. Downside scenarios include (probability 25-30%): Further terrorist attacks andor an unsuccessful US retaliation; Oil prices spike again; and Consumer and business confidence falls further and doesn't recover as quickly as anticipated. The upside scenario includes the following (probability 15-20%): US retaliation is considered to be successful; Consumer and business confidence rebounds quickly; and The recession in the US and the rest of the world is mild.

The high level investments have increased paper and paperboard production by 1 million tonnes in the last five years,\" he added. Spain is high in the ranking of pulp and paper producers in the European Union (EU), with 15 pulp mills and 132 paper and board mills. Pulp production rose by 4.2 percent to 1.750 million tonnes. In total, Spain consumed 6.824 million tonnes of paper and board in 2000, some 6 percent higher than the previous year, taking the total growth figure for the past five years to 32 percent. Despite the dramatic growth figures, Spaniards consume just 171 kgcapita of paper and board. When this figure is compared to the US's 347 kgcapita, German levels of 215 kgcapita or 245 kgcapita in Sweden, it is clear that Spain's pulp and paper industry has huge growth potential. Home grown Pulp consumption rose by 11 percent to 1.578 million tonnes in 2000. Spain's pulp and paper producers sourced 27 percent of the wood and 17 percent of the recovered paper used as raw materials in 2000 through imports. The industry is working toward ways to source its furnish domestically though. To reduce Spain's raw materials deficit, both paper recovery and the harvesting of fast-growing species on wasteland need to be increased, ASPAPEL said. New technologies Demand for printingwriting grades has leapt up by 31 percent over the same period to arrive at 1.957 million tonnes last year. The market has developed in tandem with the growth in demand for electronics and personal computers in Spain. Household and sanitary papers Demand for household and sanitary papers has risen by 35 percent between 1995-2000. Spain consumed 455,000 tonnes of these grades past year. Suppliers have fed the growing demand for tissue and sanitary products with the launch of new cleaning products and introduced new applications for personal hygiene and health goods. Trade imbalance Last year, Spain's producers exported 827,000 tonnes of pulp and 1.475 tonnes of paper. Exports accounted for 43 percent or nearly Pta 300 billion (Euro 2,164 million) of the overall turnover of Euro 4,100 million. The lion's share of exports went to EU countries, 89 percent for pulp. On the pulp side, exports dropped by 2.8 percent last year which came as a result of an 11 percent increase in domestic consumption. For every kilogram of pulp imported into Spain, the country exports 1.3 kg. Imports rose by 10.7 percent to 656,000 tonnes in 2000.Spain is one of the leading producers of eucalyptus pulp and domestic consumption of wood for pulp production stood at 5.564 million m3 in 2000.

            "paperloop.com SAN FRANCISCO, July 18, 2001 (paperloop.com) - North American market pulp prices tumbled for the seventh time in as many months on seasonal weak demand and continued papermaker downtime. Benchmark northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) declined 7.4 percent or $40tonne to $500tonne, while other pulp grades fell less. Some producers indicated they \"have no list\" prices anymore as deals have increasingly occurred on a case-by-case basis, while one major producer said it had abandoned its list two months ago and has simply discounted. The sustained drop in prices prompted both sellers and buyers to note last week that even suppliers holding low inventories aren't able to leverage themselves in pricing. A large-volume buyer source said that his firm's discounts \"are anywhere from 5 percent to double digits,\" even off the latest prices. Many producers continued offloading pulp to markets such as China, South Korea and Taiwan as prices there appear to have leveled off at low levels. Market watchers last week expressed concern with global inventories and the wholesale exports to non-Japan Asian markets. \"I'm concerned with what will happen (to inventories) through July and August,\" said a Canadian industry consultant, who said that although pricing dynamics could improve after September, producers may fight inventory surges all year. \"I hope they don't overproduce. This cycle is harsher than most cycles because of paper downtime.\" Salomon Smith Barney analyst Chip Dillon noted in a report that the latest inventories are, \"well above the 1.5 million tonne 'inflection' level...total inventories combined typically rise over 230,000 tonnes during July and August (so) we believe pulp prices will remain under pressure.\" Various North American producers have declined selling pulp to Asian markets on below cash-cost prices, but buyers there continue to bargain hunt from second or third suppliers. Because of lower operating costs and the availability of cheap NBSK, a buyer source said that his firm's paper machines are profitably running at 100 percent through the summer season. \"Some suppliers have more inventory than others and have no choice but to sell,\" noted the buyer. Meanwhile, several pulp producers have attempted to offset poor demand conditions by further curtailing production. Tembec Inc. said it would slash its pulp output by at least 100,000 tonnes during the third quarter, matching the downtime it had taken through the first two quarters combined. Although Tembec didn't announce which mills or grades of pulp would be affected, an industry source said that Tembec was taking a month of downtime at its Crestbrook mill in Skookumchuck, B.C. With capacity to produce 227,000 tonnesyr of NBSK, the mill's downtime would represent about 19,440 tonnes. Weyerhaeuser recently told customers it would take about 54,000 tonnes of primarily NBSK market-related downtime during the third quarter. A Weyerhaeuser official said its mill in Prince Albert, Sask., would trim about 14,000 tonnes of NBSK and NBHK; 24,000 tonnes of NBSK would be cut at its mill in Grand Prairie, Alta., at a time to be determined later; and its Kamloops, B.C., mill would cut 16,500 tonnes of NBSK during outages in August and September. Additionally, the official expected that incremental tonnage would be lost during some maintenance downtime during the quarter. The downtime at Weyerhaeuser \"reflects softness in fine paper demand,\" said the official. \"Demand to Europe is particularly soft and with the strong dollar we have currency issues.\" Other producers are reducing supplies without acknowledging their curtailments. Producer sources in British Columbia said that Celgar Pulp Co. in Castlegar, B.C., would shut down production for about 35 days due to market reasons. With capacity to produce about 425,000 tonnesyr of NBSK, the outage could clip about 42,490 tonnes from supplies. A source at Western Pulp Ltd. said the Vancouver, B.C., firm had extended the shutdown its 255,000 tonneyr NBSK pulp mill in Squamish due to continued soft demand. The downtime, which began on June 1, is expected to total six weeks, said the source. Western Pulp's Squamish operation will likely cut at least 30,000 tonnes from supplies during the closure, said the source. In Wisconsin, an NBHK mill is currently shut down for market reasons and a company source said it would chop about 20,000 tonnes from production before restarting later this month. \"In the fourth quarter, these kraft mills can't shut down,\" said the source. \"You have to run during the winter, but right now you can take a mill down.

            "paperloop. com san francisco, july 18, 2001 ( paperloop. com ) - north american market pulp prices tumbled for the seventh time in as many months on seasonal weak demand and continued papermaker downtime. benchmark northern bleached softwood kraft ( nbsk ) declined 7. 4 percent or $ 40tonne to $ 500tonne, while other pulp grades fell less. some producers indicated they \" have no list \" prices anymore as deals have increasingly occurred on a case - by - case basis, while one major producer said it had abandoned its list two months ago and has simply discounted. the sustained drop in prices prompted both sellers and buyers to note last week that even suppliers holding low inventories aren't able to leverage themselves in pricing. a large - volume buyer source said that his firm's discounts \" are anywhere from 5 percent to double digits, \" even off the latest prices. many producers continued offloading pulp to markets such as china, south korea and taiwan as prices there appear to have leveled off at low levels. market watchers last week expressed concern with global inventories and the wholesale exports to non - japan asian markets. \" i'm concerned with what will happen ( to inventories ) through july and august, \" said a canadian industry consultant, who said that although pricing dynamics could improve after september, producers may fight inventory surges all year. \" i hope they don't overproduce. this cycle is harsher than most cycles because of paper downtime. \" salomon smith barney analyst chip dillon noted in a report that the latest inventories are, \" well above the 1. 5 million tonne'inflection'level... total inventories combined typically rise over 230, 000 tonnes during july and august ( so ) we believe pulp prices will remain under pressure. \" various north american producers have declined selling pulp to asian markets on below cash - cost prices, but buyers there continue to bargain hunt from second or third suppliers. because of lower operating costs and the availability of cheap nbsk, a buyer source said that his firm's paper machines are profitably running at 100 percent through the summer season. \" some suppliers have more inventory than others and have no choice but to sell, \" noted the buyer. meanwhile, several pulp producers have attempted to offset poor demand conditions by further curtailing production. tembec inc. said it would slash its philippines pulp output by at least 100, 000 tonnes during the third quarter, matching the downtime it had taken through the first two quarters combined. although tembec didn't announce which mills or grades of pulp would be affected, an industry source said that tembec was taking a month of downtime at its crestbrook mill in skookumchuck, b. c. with capacity to produce 227, 000 tonnesyr of nbsk, the mill's downtime would represent about 19, 440 tonnes. weyerhaeuser recently told customers it would take about 54, 000 tonnes of primarily nbsk market - related downtime during the third quarter. a weyerhaeuser official said its mill in prince albert, sask., would trim about 14, 000 tonnes of nbsk and nbhk ; 24, 000 tonnes of nbsk would be cut at its mill in grand prairie, alta., at a time to be determined later ; and its kamloops, b. c., mill would cut 16, 500 tonnes of nbsk during outages in august and september. additionally, the official expected that incremental tonnage would be lost during some maintenance downtime during the quarter. the downtime at weyerhaeuser \" reflects softness in fine paper demand, \" said the official. \" demand to europe is particularly soft and with the strong dollar we have currency issues. \" other producers are reducing supplies without acknowledging their curtailments. producer sources in british columbia said that celgar pulp co. in castlegar, b. c., would shut down production for about 35 days due to market reasons. with capacity to produce about 425, 000 tonnesyr of nbsk, the outage could clip about 42, 490 tonnes from supplies. a source at western pulp ltd. said the vancouver, b. c., firm had extended the shutdown its 255, 000 tonneyr nbsk pulp mill in squamish due to continued soft demand. the downtime, which began on june 1, is expected to total six weeks, said the source. western pulp's squamish operation will likely cut at least 30, 000 tonnes from supplies during the closure, said the source. in wisconsin, an nbhk mill is currently shut down for market reasons and a company source said it would chop about 20, 000 tonnes from production before restarting later this month. \" in the fourth quarter, these kraft mills can't shut down, \" said the source. \" you have to run during the winter, but right now you can take a mill down. if the downtime isn't taken now, you will see a real bloodletting in the fourth quarter. \"\n",

            "SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 29, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Uncoated papers production has been restricted this year, with extensive downtime and permanent mill closures reducing market tonnage and thus stabilizing prices. Even with some increased demand, uncoated papers in North America, especially free-sheet, will depend on possible flooding in a near future of greater capacity. Overall, prices for uncoated papers fell slightly in August compared to July, with repro bond dipping on the low end. As expected, demand for repro bond, the most popular grade of uncoated free-sheet (UCFS), picked up in July, and several merchants reported greater volumes of paper per sale. But demand is still low compared with last year. One source, crediting downtime with the uncoated float through the weak market of the last six months, felt that prices would only dip further, as mills have stopped taking downtime. Trade book pickup? Web 50-lb trade book gained some ground on the low end. The strength of trade book transactions is due the seasonal pick up in book publishing, which takes place through September and October and targets the educational and holiday markets. With the temporary idling of several Pulp Paper of America (PPA) machines, owned by parent company American Tissue Inc., the already small coterie of trade book manufacturers will benefit from the lost tonnage, especially in lightweight book papers, according to one merchant. He added that if demand continues, the decrease in product might have a ripple effect and drive prices up. Permanent tonnage cuts in a variety of uncoated grades will aid the ailing market by better reflecting lowered demand. Mill inventories have already benefited. RISI's forecast of an uncoated upturn in the fourth quarter is also based upon those capacity curtailments, and the infrequent practice of swing capacity from coated to uncoated manufacturing. Downtime taken. Downtime taken by several companies, including Finch, Pruyn Co. and Weyerhaeuser Co. was popularly used as a means of upgrading older, less efficient machines, thereby adding more capacity to the uncoated mix overall. In addition, some so-called permanent machine shuts will simply serve as space providers for a future of more efficient and larger volume-producing machines. Willamette Industries' mothballing of two UCFS will be replaced with a larger and more efficient UCFS machine in Kingsport, Tenn., for a difference of an additional 207,000 tonsyr. Converted papers, such as forms bond, have held well price-wise, mainly because so few mills produce them. However, one West Coast company source said, \"Volume of forms bond has eroded 5-7%,\" speculating that the grade would soon be completely replaced by cutsheets. \n",

            "paperlooop.com BRUSSELS, July 31, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Sappi has taken massive downtime measures over the past three months to battle adverse trading conditions in the coated fine paper market. \"Coated fine paper is probably the worst market you can be at in 2001,\" the company's executive chairman, Eugene van As, said. \"We have taken severe production curtailments in this quarter. The market has been extremely difficult and the paper industry generally, I think, has taken a lot of curtailments,\" he added. Sappi took 150,000 tonnes of coated fine paper out of the European market during the third quarter, which equals one week a month, in a bid to match output to market requirements. The group's worldwide total downtime tonnage for the period reached almost 250,000 tonnes of coated fine paper. Sappi will continue to cut capacity in the fourth quarter but the total tonnage might not be as high as in the third quarter. There has been a clear reduction in paper consumption and advertising levels have dropped, but the company expects an upturn in consumption and demand, which would in turn mean less downtime, van As explained. The market has been hit by declining advertising revenues and huge new capacity that has come on line both in Europe and Asia. He singled out Asian Pulp Paper (APP) as one culprit for disruptions in the Asian coated fine paper market. APP has built over a million tonnes of new capacity in the last two years, and \"they are running these facilities for cash,\" van As criticized. As a result, producers have tried selling more in the US, adding pressure to that market. On the hot topic of price increases in the European coated fine paper market, van As said that Sappi has increased indent prices but stock prices have remained unchanged. \"Indent prices have slipped slightly, we brought them back to where they were before. So there hasn't been a general price increase for coated woodfree paper in Europe,\" he clarified. Sappi does not foresee a general price increase in the future either, according to van As. Sappi expects its fourth quarter results to be similar to the third quarter figures. Inventory levels are low and general economic recovery should bring relief to the industry. \"When the economic upturn happens and the inventory pipeline is empty, there will be a fairly rapid rebound in earnings for paper companies,\" van As said. \n",

            "SINGAPORE, Aug. 20, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The Japanese giant, Oji Paper, has unveiled plans to add almost 1 million tonnesyr of paper and board capacity in Asia, outside of Japan, by March 2006 at a total investment cost of Yen 150 billion ($1.2 billion). The group aims to carry out the ambitious expansion scheme through building greenfield mills or via mergers and acquisitions. Oji has already taken the first step in the project. The group raised its stake in Japan Brazil Paper and Pulp Resources Development Company (JBP) in July to become the largest shareholder. JBP is a Japanese consortium that took over Brazil's Celulose Nipo-Brasileira (CENIBRA) last month, which has a bleached eucalyptus pulp capacity of 820,000 tonnesyr. Oji shelled out Yen 18 billion for the additional JBP shares and plans to use the extra 250,000 tonnesyr of pulp from CENIBRA to cater for its Asian expansions, according to Oji's spokesman, Takao Ito. Oji has set up a special unit, Asian Research Center, to promote the expansion scheme. The project team reports directly to Oji's new president, Shoichiro Suzuki, a senior engineer who assumed the top post in late June. Suzuki said in July that Oji aims to be an Asian group led from Japan and that Thailand and China are top priorities in its portfolio, according to Ito. He added that Oji's investment targets also include Indonesia and Vietnam. Oji's 1 million tonneyr expansion goal includes building a large PM that has an uncoated and coated woodfree capacity of 500,000 tonnesyr. The remainder of the 1 million tonneyr capacity target will include 200,000 tonnesyr of newsprint or lightweight coated paper, 150,000 tonnesyr of board and 150,000 tonnesyr of specialty grades used for communication papers. Oji will fund its Asian expansion projects through increased sales and its ongoing corporate restructuring program. The group aims to cut its workforce by 2,200 to 20,900 by March 2004. \"We have reduced staff, paid off debts and reorganized group companies,\" Ito indicated. Oji expects to save Yen 8 billionyr from workforce retrenchment and Yen 3 billionyr through streamlining production. \"We see the plan as realistic and thought-out,\" said two analysts at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney, Peter Cain and Paul Blamire, in a recent report. They estimated that Oji's scheme suggested a cost of $1,200tonne, which is comparable to the reported cost of some projects in Asia in recent years. \"In Japan, the most recent major capacity addition, Hokuetsu Paper's PM 8 at the Niigata mill, cost approximately $1,825tonne,\" the report continued. \"Oji aims not to add substantial net capacity in Japan as it expands in Asia. This strategy gives it the option of producing locally for Asian markets or importing back to Japan if demand justifies,\" the report added. On top of that, the analysts believe that Oji's increased stake in CENIBRA was a sensible move \"since it avoids dependence on Indonesian pulp\". Oji has not yet announced any specific project under the Asian expansion scheme. But Suzuki revealed in July that Oji would not consider acquiring any of Asia Pulp Paper's assets this year due to its complex debt issues, or making any investments in Indonesia given the country's political and economic uncertainty, Ito said. Cain believes that the most likely move for Oji is the expansion of its operations in Thailand. The group has a mill in Prachinburi which operates a 30,000 tonneyr carbonless copy paper PM. The mill site has ample space for future growth and is adjacent to Advance Agro's (AA) plantation land. Cain pointed out that Oji owns a 5.5 percent stake in AA, but said Oji is unlikely to raise its stake in the joint venture which is still carrying out a debt restructuring program. Another factor in the country's favor is that, according to Ito, the production cost is 10 percent lower in Thailand than in Japan. Cain suggested that Oji may expand its newsprint and boxboard operations in Asia, rather than other grades where the market is already saturated. Japan imports around 60,000 tonnesyr of newsprint, which means Oji could fill this gap. In addition, Oji is very good at producing high-quality boxboard, while Asian markets still rely a lot on imports, he added. As for Oji's plan to invest in a 500,000 tonneyr coated and uncoated woodfree PM, Cain said that the group could install the unit in China but that it is not really viable. China is facing overcapacity in these grades in the near future due to a flurry of new capacity due to come online. On top of that, Stora Enso filed an application with the Chinese government for the approval of a scheme to invest in a 500,000 tonneyr coated woodfree PM late last year. The project is still at the pre-planning stage though and the approval process can take three years or more. Ito admitted that Oji has not yet submitted any expansion proposals to the authorities. \n",

            "SINGAPORE, Aug. 20, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Widespread downtime taken by Norscan softwood pulp producers has begun to affect the Asian pulp market. Prices have stabilized for the first time since September last year. Low-priced radiata pine pulp from Latin America continues to hold down prices for northern bleached softwood kraft pulp (NBSK). \"We believe that the current low prices for the grade will stay until well-stocked Chinese traders deplete inventories accumulated since April,\" one major buyer said. Some Indonesian and Thai pulp producers hope to introduce a $10-20tonne price increase for their mixed tropical hardwood and eucalyptus grades in September, followed by a further $40-60tonne rise in the fourth quarter. But buyers and some other Indonesian pulp producers are skeptical about the increase's likelihood of success as there are ample supplies of Brazilian eucalyptus selling at competitive prices across Asia. On top of that, some Indonesian pulp producers are burdened with debt and face wood supply shortages resulting from slower than anticipated progress in the planting of concession areas, illegal logging and other forestry issues. Trading volumes of Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood are in fact diminishing. Indonesian producers are currently promoting plantation-based acacia pulp, a move welcomed by environmental groups. But distributors and traders in China have received complaints from customers about the grade, in particular, from board producers. \"We seldom hear complaints in other Asian markets. The Chinese customers need some time to get accustomed to the grade,\" one Indonesian producer explained. \n",

            "paperloop.com SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 16, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Primary grades of North American market pulp declined last week as producers waited for their proactive downtime plans to take effect and many buyers easily talked down prices. Benchmark northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) fell another 4 percent, dropping $20tonne to $480tonne while other grades declined even further. Although many producers are moving to align supplies with moderate demand conditions, various sources said that softwood pulps in particular were still too abundant in the U.S and Canada. But over the short to middle term, market watchers appear less concerned with inventory levels and indicated that a cyclical bottom was very close. Some producer sources suggested that downward pressure had eased compared to last month. However, several buyers noted they had easily pushed down prices for most pulp grades. Effective list prices for southern bleached softwood kraft slipped $30tonne to $430-$440tonne on oversupply. But differential prices showed a slight anomaly as northern bleached hardwood kraft dipped only $10tonne to $420-$440tonne as the grade was said to be less abundant on the contract market. Suppliers also claimed its specialty uses allowed it to hold up compared to other grades. But southern bleached hardwood kraft (SBHK) prices saw the month's largest percentage drop, down 7 percent or $30tonne to $390-$410tonne. Still, market participants appear to be looking to the near term future with guarded optimism. Tuesday's North AmericanScandinavian (Norscan) chemical paper-grade market pulp producer inventory report may have been the first sign that producers have been able to control their stocks this year. Norscan inventories rose only 5,000 tonnes in July, well off an average July increase of 143,500 tonnes recorded over the past 10 years. Norscan stocks stood at 1.785 million tonnes at the end of July, representing 32 days of supply. Producers also held 32 days of supply in June. July inventories closed at 42.3 percent higher than year-ago results, a large improvement over the prior month's year over year 66.9 percent differential. \"When you consider the downtime and how much production is being taken out of the market in the next three months, it's quite staggering,\" said a U.S.-based agent. \"Also, look at Asian and European buyers who are building inventories in anticipation of a bottom. There are some fundamental and psychological changes in the market (that will occur) in the next month as inventories are announced and downtime continues.\" Guaranteed pricing offers. Both pulp sellers and buyers indicated there have recently been more attempts at guaranteed prices for anywhere from two to five months. A U.S.-based producer source said some buyers had proposed guaranteed prices for their contracted tonnes through the end of the year on concern of a sudden price rebound. Export markets showed mixed results. European prices again slid while Asian markets such as China and Korea appeared to level off. Consumer downtime continues to hit suppliers, but an Asian buyer said downtime at his firm's paper mills averaging a week per month were tempered by already low pulp prices. Hardwood pulps also appear to have leveled off there despite continued aggressive maneuvering from Brazilian producers that over the past few months have adjusted their prices to compete with Indonesian and other suppliers. In U.S. spot markets, NBSK pulp prices recently declined just over 2 percent compared to recent weeks, and apparently have come to mirror contract prices in non-Japan Asia. \"NBSK spot prices seem to have bottomed out. List and spot prices are converging, which has always (signaled) a bottom,\" said Gordon Floe of NLK Consultants, who suggested that NBSK spot prices in the U.S. had already bottomed at $400tonne weeks ago. \"But there is still a lot of pain for the producers in contract tonnage. Contract and spot needs to converge before a recovery will happen.\" Prices for spot NBSK delivered in the Northeast or Midwest declined $10tonne to $410-$440tonne last week on paperloop's spot market price index. Recent paperloop spot prices represent a middle range of transactions, and closed 11.5 percent below August contract prices. \n",

            "BRUSSELS, Aug. 10, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Several European paper producers, together with South Africa's Sappi, have taken severe downtime in the second quarter to prevent paper and board prices from plummeting due to weak demand. Sappi has taken massive downtime measures to battle adverse trading conditions in the coated fine paper market. The company took 150,000 tonnes of coated woodfree paper out of the European market during its third quarter ending June 30, which equals one week per month. The group's worldwide total curtailments for the period reached almost 250,000 tonnes of coated fine paper. Sappi will continue to cut capacity in its fourth quarter ending September 30, but the total tonnage may not be as high as in its third quarter. Stora Enso has also curtailed production in an effort to try and maintain prices. The company took 558,000 tonnes of paper and board out of the European and North American markets during the second quarter. Of that, 342,000 tonnes was market-related. Stora Enso does not foresee price pressure easing over the next few months and expects further market related curtailments will be necessary. The production cuts took 61,000 tonnes of magazine paper out of North America and 75,000 tonnes out of the European market. Fine paper output was slashed by 93,000 tonnes in Europe and 63,000 tonnes in North America. Packaging board production was cut by 50,000 tonnes. UPM-Kymmene has followed a policy of \"strict inventory management\" in order to defend prices against erosion in the face of slack demand. The company's global market related cutbacks totaled 410,000 tonnes in the first six months of this year, with 290,000 tonnes of downtime taken in the second quarter. A company spokesman would not reveal the breakdown for each grade but said, \"There is no big difference between publication paper and fine paper.\" UPM-Kymmene indicated that coated groundwood prices are still under pressure and said the company will continue to wield the downtime sword if necessary. M-real also plans to continue cutting fine paper production in the third quarter, following massive downtime measures in the second quarter. M-real chopped its total paper output by 245,000 tonnes during the April-June period, of which almost 200,000 tonnes was fine paper. Total fine paper downtime for the January-June period reached 300,000 tonnes. The producer's capacity utilization ratio for coated fine paper slumped to 80 percent in the first six months of this year and the figure for uncoated fine paper stood at 93 percent. Price rise push While M-real has taken aggressive measures to balance production and demand, the company has also been trying to improve coated woodfree prices. Negotiations to raise indent prices for coated woodfree paper in Germany have been followed by similar measures in France. The company is confident that it will be successful in its plans to bring the weaker indent levels closer to stock prices. Sappi has also increased indent prices for coated woodfrees but stock prices have remained unchanged. \"Indent prices have slipped slightly, we brought them back to where they were before. So there hasn't been a general price increase for coated woodfree paper in Europe,\" the company's executive chairman Eugene van As clarified. Sappi does not foresee a general price increase in the near future.

            "NEW YORK, Aug. 29, 2001 (Reuters) - The merger announced on Wednesday between paper producers Mead Corp and Westvaco Corp reminded investors that the consolidation of the fragmented global forest products industry is far from over and the focus will soon switch to other potential targets, analysts said. The $3 billion stock-swap deal, which will create North America's No 4 paper company, follows a series of substantial takeovers in the forest products industry in the past few years. Yet still, the top five global players -- International Paper Co, Georgia-Pacific Corp, Weyerhaeuser Co, Kimberly-Clark Corp, and Stora Enso -- accounted for only an estimated 30% of the industry's sales last year, leaving much room for more marriages. By comparison, the top five players in the automobile or chemical industries control about 50% of their markets. \"This industry is not finished yet -- they are going to come in the next couple of years,\" Mark Connelly, analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, said of further mergers among paper companies. While unlikely, some analysts said that Mead or Westvaco could attract counteroffers from anyone willing to pay even a slight premium to terms unveiled on Wednesday. Recent consolidation in the industry has been spearheaded by European companies, as they tend to think more globally, he said. Big deals by European papermakers include Finnish-Swedish Stora Enso's acquisition of Wisconsin-based Consolidated Paper and Finnish papermaker UPM-Kymmene's purchase of four mills from German magazine paper maker Haindl. Not just the Europeans North American players have also been active on the acquisition front in recent years. In the last two years, International Paper bought Union Camp for $5 billion, Stone Container Corp of the US merged with the US unit of Jefferson Smurfit Group of Ireland and Weyerhaeuser Co bought Macmillan. In Canada, Abitibi-Consolidated Inc joined hands with Norske Skogindustrier AS of Norway and Hansol Paper of South Korea to set up an Asian newsprint company in a $1.4 billion alliance. \"Consolidation will continue to be global -- there is a whole lot more that needs to happen both here and in Europe,\" said Connelly. Although the rate of consolidation has picked up in recent years, deals among the industry's main players may not pick up pace any time soon as giants such as IP, which acquired Champion International last year, digest their new holdings and streamline their businesses. Low pulp prices, weak export markets due to the strong dollar, and slowing demand related to the softened US economy have made this process more difficult than previously envisaged. \"It's like the tiger is digesting -- once he's finished digesting he's going to go on the hunt again,\" said Joshua Zaret, an analyst with ABN Amro. \"Likely acquirers have other agendas right now.\" The big players may return to the acquisition trail within the next 12 to 18 months, Zaret said. Companies with assets in Latin America are likely to be one target. A recent Standard Poor's study of the forest products industry showed that the more profitable European companies now prefer investing in South America rather than pumping money into US assets, which have been hit by the strong dollar and increasing cost of energy. Shares of several companies often pinpointed as potential acquisition targets rose on Wednesday on news of the Mead and Westvaco merger, including office and wood products maker Boise Cascade Corp and No 2 North American newsprint producer Bowater Inc. \"You will see a handful of players in each of the major grades,\" said Zaret when asked what the paper products industry will look like three years from now. \"I think where we are we are well advanced with more to come.\" \n",

Some industry sources indicated that a closing between list prices and spot transactions could point to tighter supplies in spot markets later this year. Prices for spot NBSK delivered in the Northeast or Midwest held at $410-440tonne, 11.5% below August contract prices, paperloop sources said. Although there have been anecdotal cases of buyers procuring NBSK at $400tonne in the Northeast, a producer asserted the deals must have come from one supplier. Southern bleached softwood kraft (SBSK) on the spot market also remained flat, holding its $390-420tonne range of two weeks ago. Northern bleached hardwood kraft (NBHK), the only grade to hold flat in spot markets two weeks ago, remained unchanged at $340-380tonne. Evidently moving to protect pricing, some mills last week curbed supplies even though buys were said to be available at typical spot prices. In a growing recent trend, one NBHK supplier closed a five-month deal at a fixed price of $370tonne, on the high end of current spot prices but barely covering its cash cost of production.

The investment bank said that $460 was the cash cost of producing for the highest-cost producers, so it should represent the very bottom of pricing in the current cycle. But MSDW said in its morning preview note that it was not lowering its earnings forecasts for the major European paper producers as the integrated manufacturers have little or no exposure to prices of market pulp. The major European producers include the world's second biggest papermaker Stora Enso and third biggest UPM-Kymmene, Finnish M-real, Norwegian Norske Skog and the European operations of South African Sappi. \"It would take lower paper price forecasts for us to reduce our earnings estimates,\" MSDW said. \"So far, aggressive producer downtime has kept paper prices from collapsing, however, we do expect second-quarter results to be down from the first quarter and the risks to our estimates for the full-year 2001 remain to the downside.\" Prices of long-fibre pulp have dropped 31 percent this year, to current levels around $491 per tonne as the global economy has cooled and manufacturers of fine paper have sharply curbed output to take up slack in global demand.

This has been caused by factors such as higher prices in Asia, timber supply problems and environmental pressure. Eucalyptus is available on the spot market for $340-360tonne, which, after discounts and rebates are taken into account, is little different to the regular transaction price of approximately $400tonne.

            "BRUSSELS, Aug. 23, 2001 (paperloop.com) - In a quiet market due to the mid-year vacation period, there have been reports that buyers have sought to settle pulp prices for the next three months. This suggests that the threat of a price rise in the near future is being taken seriously, or at least that prices are believed to have fallen as low as possible. The fear of buying pulp today on the basis that it might be cheaper tomorrow seems to have all but disappeared. Virtually unchanged Norscan inventories for July were greeted with enthusiasm in many quarters. The average rise in July is 147,000 tonnes and this year, the increase was a mere 5,000 tonnes to 1.785 million tonnes, based on an operating rate of 84.6%. The doom merchants who did not believe the industry capable of controlling stocks have been proved wrong, according to some sources who believe all that is needed now is a good Norscan result for August, and the market will be ready for a price rise in the fourth quarter. The widespread attitude to such optimism was succinctly summarized by one supplier who said, \"One should never talk down somebody who's talking up the market,\" which is, of course, very different from agreeing with the viewpoint. Firm signs of a recovery are absent as yet, and as one supplier put it, \"There is still a lot less paper being used than we would like.\" The rate of decline of the FOEX pulp benchmark price of northern bleached softwood kraft and eucalyptus has slowed down and buyers are reportedly happier to put their names on bales of pulp now than they were a month ago. The result is a gradual shift in inventory from seller to buyer. Suppliers have made it clear that they are unwilling to go any lower on the price front just to get business. The motivation for price rises is particularly strong in Europe, as the improvement of the euro has changed the relatively strong position of the Euro-zone producers. As such, any increase would be dressed up as a \"correction\". But North American producers are also strongly motivated to raise prices as they are operating at uneconomic levels. The danger feared by many analysts is that suppliers, encouraged by dwindling stocks, will crank up their production again and put paid to any chances of a price recovery. Certain short fiber producers from South America are reported to have abandoned the Italian market temporarily as price demands in the country have hit lows that these suppliers are not prepared to entertain. Uncertainty over the future of Indonesian short fiber supplies is also helping to shore up the hardwood supply position elsewhere. The spot market continues to dwindle in importance and buyers reported they are receiving far fewer unsolicited offers of cheap pulp than earlier on in the mid-year vacation period.\n",

            "paperloop.com BRUSSELS, July 26, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Financial and logistical problems as well as unattractive prices have diminished Europe's attractiveness as a market for Indonesian hardwood pulp suppliers, who were blamed for the dramatic fall in hardwood pulp prices. On top of that, reported action in Italy by an environmental group against a paper producer said to be buying Indonesian pulp is another factor that may have stemmed the flow of Indonesian hardwood to the region. While the action was said to be \"nothing new\" by one importer of Indonesian pulp, he conceded that buyers were asking more questions about the timber source for these products in the wake of the campaign. Another supplier added, \"This means that certain customers will not use Indonesian pulps anymore.\" Separately, the environmental group Friends of the Earth has mounted a high profile campaign in the UK against the use of non-plantation hardwood in papermaking. Prices near bottom Market pulp prices remain hard to pin down. As one buyer put it, \"All the numbers are low and all the numbers are fluid.\" Eucalyptus pricing is particularly elusive as more deals which are a mixture of regular and spot business emerge. As gross prices for regular business net down to something very similar to spot offers, there is a genuine reason to believe that the bottom has been reached for this grade. Northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) prices slipped gently between FOEX's July 17 figure of $478.91tonne and $477.27tonne on July 24, although most buyers agree, and sellers concede, that new deals for regular business are likely to be done at $460tonne. Spot prices for NBSK are even lower at a price below which many North American producers fail to break even. Downtime was insufficient to prevent these break-even levels from being reached. There is little room for spot prices to fall further. More downtime can be expected in the Norscan countries as a result of such weak prices. Norske Skog Canada has announced a further 14,000 tonnes of market pulp downtime, which brings the company's third quarter market pulp curtailment up to 28,000 tonnes. If inventories remain static for the next two months, during a period when they traditionally rise, and then fall during the fourth quarter, this would set the scene for prices to creep up again in the first quarter next year or even before. A strong dollar and poor worldwide economic performance will hamper any rapid change in the pulp market's fortunes though. Evidence that the market is approaching a period of price stability is mounting. One supplier reported, \"We have already had some requests from customers to price pulp for July and August, which is an indication that they think we have reached the bottom.\" Pulp consumption in June dropped by more than 5 percent compared to May, according to UTIPULP figures. The participating countries reported consumption of 1,044,359 tonnes in June, which left stocks virtually unchanged at 1,046,052 tonnes. This equates to some 28 days' worth of pulp. \n",

Even considering the increase in South Korean uncoated free-sheet and European uncoated mechanical imports, prices managed to remain relatively stable, dipping only slightly in what many producers and merchants are calling the most depressed market in over two decades. One forms bond manufacturer and one merchant both stated that, while business was \"lousy,\" prices were holding. However, spot market deals dramatically impacted rolls of uncoated 50-lb offset. Another trend in publishing spheres is downgrading from uncoated free-sheet to cheaper, uncoated white groundwood. Sources said that, although these groundwood alternatives do not meet all the specifications for permanence, they are being sold in increasing volumes by Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. and Alliance Forest Products Inc., which Bowater Inc. plans to acquire. The largest grade of uncoated free-sheet in production, demand, and sales is repro bond, yet reprographic paper takes an annual downturn in the summer months due to lowered office demand and school closures. End uses for the paper are in personal printers andor photocopiers. Most merchants expect a swell in demand in August, when schools will actively bid. Another factor in the expected increase of repro usage is the decrease in heavier trade book and offset uncoated papers. Some paper manufacturers, praising North American mills in their choice to take downtime rather than discount across-the-board, felt that continental production has more of an impact on the domestic market than imports. From January to March of this year, the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI) released figures that put uncoated mechanical exports 3.7 percent higher in the first quarter than year-to-date figures. Indeed, extensive downtime has been the saving grace of uncoated papers over the last six months, sources said. Beginning in the first quarter with exorbitant energy costs in the U.S. West, and continuing through the lack of demand in the second and third quarters, lost tonnage has saved manufacturers the costs of energy, freight, surplus inventory, and labor. \n",

            "paperloop.com SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 8, 2001 (paperloop.com) - North American printing and writing paper production dropped 301,000 tonnes in June compared with production for June of 2000, and producers operated at just 84 percent of capacity for June, according to the Pulp and Paper Products Council (PPPC). Along with the decreased production compared with last year, overall printing and writing paper inventories decreased by 68,000 tonnes in June from May's level, and was down 152,000 tonnes compared with the June 2000 inventory total. Most of that stock decline was at uncoated free-sheet mills, primarily due to downtime. Coated free-sheet paper inventories remained relatively unaffected, dropping only 4,000 tonnes in June. Total coated free-sheet demand plummeted 21 percent in June compared with year-ago results. Less downtime in June. While overall printing and writing paper operating rates were down to 84 percent in June in North America, less downtime was taken in June compared with May, when printing and writing papers' operating rate was only 79 percent. The increased production in June was dependent upon an anticipated swell in demand. Production of lightweight coated (LWC) and coated groundwood usually pick up in the third quarter with demand from the catalog market. In addition, the seasonal swell in demand for uncoated free-sheet (especially reprographic paper for school and office use) begins in August, when large accounts begin their bids. The decrease in production of coated free-sheet and coated groundwood paper has helped save North American manufacturers in a weak market. But overall lack of domestic demand, a strong U.S. dollar impeding export, and less expensive imported coated papers has contributed to the sliding prices of coated papers in the U.S. since April. With magazine subscriptions low and magazine pages down by 20 percent largely due to a decrease in advertising, the coated paper producers said they hope that the start of the holiday catalog season will stimulate sales. Import competition. According to the PPPC, overseas imports of coated groundwood to North America dipped 13 percent when compared with June 2000 imports. Even though quantity has fallen, domestic manufacturers are having a hard time competing with less expensive Asian and European coated paper. Uncoated free-sheet witnessed a rush of overseas imports in June, up 67.1 percent compared with June 2000. Overall, however, uncoated free-sheet shipments to the U.S. and Canada fell 74,000 tonnes (6 percent) compared with June 2000 shipments. The U.S. was aggressively exporting coated free-sheet to Canada through May this year. The U.S. shipped 128,900 tons in the first five months to Canada, up from 92,500 tons in the first five months of 2000, according to AFPA. Inventory decline. Total inventories of printing and writing papers are tightening. Coated inventories remain high, however. In May, coated paper and coated groundwood inventory combined was at 820,000 tonnes, just 5,000 tonnes less than the inventory in June 2000. Inventories of uncoated free-sheet and uncoated groundwood papers slid steadily throughout the second quarter, totaling 1.682 million tonnes in June compared with 1.83 million tonnes in inventory in June 2000. Canadian mill shipments fell as much as 16.4 percent since last June for coated groundwood, according to the PPPC. Coated free-sheet shipments from Canada also fell 10.7 percent, reflecting a very loose North American market for coated paper overall. However, Canadian shipments of uncoated groundwood remained solid. Overall printing and writing paper shipments from Canada totaled 3.3 million tons in the first half of this year, down 4.2 percent compared with first half 2000 shipments. \n",

            "SINGAPORE, Aug. 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Spot pulp prices in China and Korea seem to have hit rock bottom and hardwood pulp prices are showing signs of rallying. Overall pulp buying is picking up thanks to the current low prices. Supply has tightened for several grades, but sources are wary of any optimistic prediction that pulp prices will surge upward by the end of the year. The benchmark northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) grade is trading at $390-400tonne on the Korean and Chinese spot markets. Prices slipped to as low as $380tonne in early August, but have now begun to bounce back. Buying activity has firmed up in China in particular. The upward price movement in NBSK has been held back by a flurry of radiata pine pulp shipments from Latin America to Asia though. Suppliers slashed the list price of radiata pine pulp to $370tonne, a $40tonne drop, for Chinese buyers in early August. The volumes supplied at this low price level were eaten up within the following few days and the next deliveries will arrive at Chinese ports after the end of September. Given the extensive shipments to come, it is hard to see radiata pine pulp prices moving up in China until the end of the year, unless producers announce price hikes, according to one major trader in Beijing. The grade is selling at $370-380tonne in China and Korea. Russian bleached softwood pulp has maintained stable trading volumes in China. Prices are now almost on a par with radiata pine levels at $360-380tonne. In the hardwood sector, sales of Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood pulp have been contracting due to a lack of supply. This has led to a buoyant market for Brazilian eucalyptus, which is changing hands for $380-390tonne in the Chinese and Korean spot markets, up $10tonne from last week. But sources said that Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood pulp still plays a key role in the regional market. Paper mills are in the habit of using this grade. On top of that, once normal supply resumes, and as prices are $20tonne below eucalyptus, many paper mills may decide to purchase Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood grade in the price-sensitive spot market, one trader said. \n",

The company said in a statement it agreed with workers at the Jalisco state plant to terminate and replace a collective bargaining contract in place for 55 years.

If the companies were to merge, they would create a forest industry giant with annual sales of more than SEK 400 billion ($38.68 billion). IP is the world's largest papermaker in terms of output and Stora Enso is number two. Dagens Industri said it was basing its reports on sources which it did not identify. Officials at Stora Enso were not immediately available for comment. Were a merger to take place, it would create a dominant sector player with a market capitalization of some $30 billion, according to data from Reuters Securities 3000. Consolidation has picked up in the forest industry over the past few years as firms try to counter cyclical trends and the slowing global economy. Stora Enso bought US Consolidated Paper in 2000 to vault the firm into number two globally, while sector leader IP bought US Champion International also last year after winning a bidding war with Finnish UPM-Kymmene . IP shares ended flat at $41.04 overnight, while Stora Enso shares in Helsinki slipped slightly to Euro 12.32 ($11.29). \n",

            " Andrew, The following is a follow-up to our conversation yesterday regarding implementation of a monitoring process for North American consumer pulp inventories. As it wouldn't be cost-effective to monitor all consumers, I thought we should define a sample that would be most representative of the total consumer inventory picture. Accordingly, as 70% of all North American market pulp is consumed by uncoated freesheet, tissue, and newsprint producers I believe covering the largest producers in these segments would suffice. I've identified these producers as follows: Newsprint - the listed three represent approximately 66% of market pulp consumption by newsprint Abitibi (5,783,000 tons) Bowater (3,692,000 tons) Kruger (1,084,000 tons) Uncoated Freesheet - the listed four represent approx. 63% of market pulp consumption by UCFS. Note that the next two largest producers are Weyerhaeuser and Willamette, with 9% market share each. I suggest we monitor GP as we'll already be doing so as part of the tissue segment (see below). Additionally, if Weyerhaeuser is successful in its bid for Willamette, we may be able to increase total coverage to 81% by adding only one more company. I'd suggest we wait for an outcome before making a decision. International Paper (4,578,000 tons) Domtar (2,309,000 tons) Boise Cascade (1,579,000 tons) Georgia Pacific (1,349,000 tons) Tissue - the listed three represent 68% of market pulp consumption by Tissue. The remainder of the market is highly fragmented. Georgia Pacific (2,721,000 tons) Kimberly Clark (1,330,000 tons) Procter Gamble (1,110,000 tons) If you could provide your feedback by the end of this week, I can begin discussing the feasibility of this with Competitive Intelligence.

            "BRUSSELS, Aug. 30, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The European coated woodfree market has seen a welcome boost, with producers launching attempts to raise prices. M-real took the lead in July when it announced having started negotiations with customers to raise coated woodfree indent prices in Germany. The French market was the company's next target. Stora Enso has also kicked off talks to increase indent prices for coated woodfree paper. South Africa's Sappi said it has already managed to improve its indent levels in Europe. But the companies have remained tight-lipped on the amount of the increases. The success of the planned price hikes will be seen in September or October at the latest. Producers have backed up their efforts to raise prices with massive production curtailments. Germany is reportedly a hive of activity, having been the starting point for the price negotiations. Merchants and producers have indicated that prices were set to rise in late August and September to pre-vacation period levels, market watchers said. Suppliers have been able to squeeze some of the increases through already. Prices for coated woodfree sheets improved by DM 50tonne at the bottom end of the range in July, having dipped by DM 50tonne in June. Prices for coated woodfree reels remained steady in June and July. French prices dropped by FF 100-200tonne in July and levels slipped by a further FF 100tonne in August. June saw no price movements, but some levels eroded by FF 100tonne in May. One supplier to the French market indicated it will raise prices by around 5% in October. But at least one buyer gave the move the thumbs down, saying, \"I will not accept any increases.\" In the UK, coated woodfree reels slid by ?10tonne in June and both reels and sheets fell by ?20tonne in July. The UK market continues to be difficult for suppliers. One buyer indicated there has not been much buying activity in reels and as a result, some producers have tried to attract more business by lowering prices. Italian levels have also weakened. In July, prices for coated woodfree reels slid by ITL 50-100kg and offset sheets by ITL 50kg. There have been rumors of offset sheets being offered at ITL 200kg below regular levels on the spot market. Soft demand has taken its toll on the coated woodfree sector across Europe. Several suppliers admitted that there has been a reduction in end-user demand. On top of that, the market became even quieter due to the mid-year vacation period. Dwindling advertising expenditure is one major culprit behind the lack of orders, along with the drop-off in dot.com initial public offerings (IPO). Advertising budgets have been cut and the need to print IPO information material has disappeared, as there have been fewer dot.com companies listing on the stock exchanges this year, market watchers said. There is light at the end of the tunnel though, as some sources have already reported healthy order books for September. One player indicated that the market has reached the bottom, but said the burning question now is how long the market will stay there. The arrival of the euro in January 2002 is expected to boost demand, sources reported. Governments and monetary institutions will print leaflets and brochures on the adoption of the currency and a fair amount of these orders is about to trickle through to printers and producers. Some papermakers are pinning their hopes on revived advertising budgets, as spending on this has a tendency to rise in the second half of the year. Although one printer said the current printing situation is \"very grim\", he expected the market to bottom out in August and then turn upward when the catalogue season kicks in during September. \n",

            "paperloop.com SAN FRANCISCO, July 17, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Samoa Pacific Cellulose, LLC said yesterday it would restart production at its 200,000 tonneyr pulp mill in Northern California about 10 days ahead of schedule. The shutter, which began June 23, is slated to end Friday, said a company source. \"We had projected around a month of downtime,\" said the source, who indicated that Samoa Pacific's downtime would still total about 17,700 tonnes for the third quarter. Based on the mill's capacity, it will have lost about 15,500 tonnes during the 27-day shutter. \"We would hope not to go down again for the year. Four weeks (of market related downtime) was projected but we didn't know if it would slide another week or not.\" The Samoa mill produces 100 percent chlorine-free processed (TCF) bleached and unbleached softwood and hardwood kraft pulps. The official noted that the mill will \"do as much bleached pulp as we can sell\" as it moves to supply more specialized pulps and less commodity tonnage, which has taken the largest hit in prices both in the U.S. and Asia. Roughly 50 percent of the mill's output is sold to Asian markets. \"We've been looking for better markets and developing new customers and maintaining our current ones,\" said the source. \"U.S. prices seem a little better for what we're doing, more specialty in the U.S. Unfortunately, unbleached is in demand in Asia where it's commodity.\"\n",

            "paperloop.com BRUSSELS, Aug. 10, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Europe is no longer the happy hunting ground it was for spot deal makers. With a weak Euro and rock bottom prices for regular business, there is little room for undercutting without sinking below production costs. North American suppliers of spot hardwood tonnes have gradually disappeared from the European scene since the beginning of July. Their home market is a more lucrative place in present conditions. Canadian producers are already selling pulp at below full costs of production and suppliers from other parts of the world are coming up against the same predicament. Eucalyptus, as one buyer in Germany put it, \"doesn't really exist on the spot market any more.\" There is still some softwood around for those who seek spot tonnage. But the downtime which pulp mills have been forced to take, allied to the fact that there is precious little difference between the spot deals and the price for regular business, means buyers are more likely to be pestered by their regular suppliers to take their normal quota than by hawkers of spot tonnes out to do a deal. What little Canadian NBSK that is available on the European spot market is priced at around $400tonne. This is rather more than the Scandinavian equivalent, which has arrived on the market thanks to the over-production which June's Norscan figures revealed. Much of this pulp, which is available at some $20-30tonne cheaper than Canadian NBSK, has found its way to Asia and the Middle East to compete for Government tenders. The availability of spot tonnes from Scandinavian producers could frustrate regular European buyers who need no extra tonnes and would have to break contracts to take advantage of this cheaper surplus. Reports of much stronger buying activity in Asia also explain a shift in spot pulp supply away from Europe. But this could be tempered marginally by a fall in the price of radiata pine pulp supplied to the region by Latin American producers. The Pulpex August 2001 NBSK contract closed up $10.25 last week at $407.5 DDU net. Pulpex is not an exact mirror of the spot market but has proved a useful barometer and this rise suggests that there is at least little more downward pressure on spot prices. Spot prices in Europe during the week ending August 10 were: NBSK $370 - 400tonne, eucalyptus $330 -340tonne. \n",
